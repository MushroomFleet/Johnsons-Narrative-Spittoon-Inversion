# WESTWICK POLICE DEPARTMENT
## DETECTIVE BUREAU PROCEDURE MANUAL
### SPECIAL PROCEDURES FOR WATERLOGGED CRIME SCENES

**DOCUMENT CLASSIFICATION: DEPARTMENT CONFIDENTIAL**
**LAST UPDATED: MARCH 1953**

## I. JURISDICTION PROTOCOLS

1. **District Assignment**
   * The Heights & Stilts Districts: Detective Division Alpha (DDA)
   * Harbor Town & Shallows: Detective Division Beta (DDB)
   * Drowntown & Depths: Detective Division Gamma (DDG)
   * Cross-district cases require joint investigation authorization from precinct captains

2. **Water Level Determination**
   * Stage 1: Surface (dry conditions) - Standard procedures apply
   * Stage 2: Shallow (ankle to knee depth) - Modified evidence collection
   * Stage 3: Wading (knee to waist depth) - Specialized equipment required
   * Stage 4: Deep (above waist) - Diving protocols mandatory
   * Stage 5: Submerged (fully underwater) - DDG specialist team only

3. **Jurisdictional Disputes**
   * Harbor Authority supersedes WPD in all active waterways and commercial shipping areas
   * Tidal Commission authorization required for any investigation involving flood control infrastructure
   * Luna Corp Security has jurisdiction on all company property (as per City Ordinance 48-J)

## II. EQUIPMENT REQUIREMENTS BY WATER STAGE

1. **Stage 1-2 (Surface to Shallow)**
   * Standard detective kit with waterproof case
   * Department-issued jetsoles
   * Water-resistant evidence bags and markers
   * Portable water testing kit (contamination analysis)

2. **Stage 3 (Wading)**
   * All Stage 1-2 equipment
   * Waterproof flashlight with fogcutter attachment
   * Extendable sampling equipment
   * Flotation devices for evidence preservation
   * Basic sonarscope for bottom scanning

3. **Stage 4-5 (Deep/Submerged)**
   * All Stage 3 equipment
   * Full diving apparatus with communication gear
   * Underwater photography equipment
   * Advanced sonarscope with recording capability
   * Submersible evidence containment units
   * Dive partner mandatory (no solo investigation)

## III. EVIDENCE COLLECTION PROCEDURES

1. **Documentation Protocols**
   * Record water level and tidal stage at time of discovery
   * Document drift patterns in area (use standard current marker dye)
   * Note water clarity and contamination level
   * Map underwater topography for submerged scenes
   * Calculate time-in-water estimates based on degradation

2. **Body Recovery**
   * Stage 1-3: Standard procedures with waterproof body bag
   * Stage 4-5: Specialized lifting equipment and flotation devices required
   * All water-recovered bodies must be examined for:
     * Water in lungs (drowning vs. "splash job" determination)
     * Specialized water creature activity
     * Current-related injuries vs. ante-mortem wounds
     * Evidence of weight attachment (common in deliberate disposals)

3. **Physical Evidence**
   * All items recovered from water must be:
     * Photographed in situ before recovery
     * Measured for depth and drift distance from reference points
     * Tested for residual lunar material contamination
     * Preserved in isolation containers if water-reactive
   * Paper documents require immediate preservation treatment
   * Electronic devices must be sealed in dryboxes before transport

4. **Witness Canvassing**
   * Floatfolk communities require Harbor Authority liaison
   * Water taxi operators must be formally interviewed in all Stage 3-5 cases
   * Salvage divers may have prior knowledge of area - check licenses
   * For Depth cases, consult "water rat" informant network via established contacts

## IV. SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

1. **Lunar Material Protocols**
   * Any evidence showing traces of lunar material (blue phosphorescence under UV light) requires:
     * Immediate notification to Precinct Captain
     * Specialized containment procedures
     * Moon Runner smuggling investigation cross-reference
     * Possible Tidal Commission involvement

2. **Flooding Patterns**
   * Unusual water level changes must be documented
   * Evidence movement prediction based on tidal charts required
   * Consultation with Tidal Engineers for anomalous conditions
   * Depth cases must account for structural instability of submerged buildings

3. **Time Factors**
   * Evidence degradation accelerated by water exposure (see appendix for rates)
   * Witness reliability decreases dramatically for submerged incidents
   * Body condition assessment requires specialized training for water immersion
   * Water temperature calculations critical for time-of-death determination

4. **Transportation Considerations**
   * Stage A: Standard department vehicles
   * Stage B: Amphibious vehicles only
   * Stage C: Water taxi requisition authorized
   * Stage D-E: Department submersible with qualified operator required

## V. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS

1. **Case Classification**
   * Standard case prefix followed by water stage designation (1-5)
   * "L" suffix required for any case involving lunar material
   * "TC" suffix required for any case potentially involving Tidal Commission
   * "HC" suffix required for cases with Harbor Authority coordination

2. **Required Attachments**
   * Water condition report (salinity, contamination, temperature)
   * Tidal position chart for 48 hours prior to discovery
   * Current mapping for evidence drift calculation
   * Underwater topology report for Stages 4-5
   * Luna Corp notice of investigation (if applicable)

3. **Chain of Custody**
   * Water-recovered evidence requires additional processing sign-offs
   * Drying procedures must be documented for all water-exposed items
   * Lunar contamination screening results required for all evidence
   * Specialized storage requirements must be noted for water-damaged items

## VI. INTERAGENCY PROTOCOLS

1. **Harbor Authority Cooperation**
   * Joint jurisdiction negotiation via Captain-level authorization only
   * Evidence sharing requires dual-agency documentation
   * Harbor patrol reports must be included in all waterway cases
   * Water traffic logs to be requested for all Stage 3-5 investigations

2. **Tidal Commission Interaction**
   * TC representative required for all cases involving flood infrastructure
   * Measurement data may be classified and redacted from public reports
   * Evidence of lunar material requires TC notification within 4 hours
   * Commission may assume jurisdiction with Director-level authorization

3. **Luna Corp Security**
   * Corporate security may observe but not interfere with WPD investigation
   * Technology recovery requires dual-custody protocols
   * Employee interviews must have Luna Corp counsel present
   * Evidence of corporate espionage requires specialized handling

4. **Medical Examiner Coordination**
   * Water recovery form must accompany all bodies
   * Specialized autopsy procedures for immersion victims
   * Toxicology must include lunar material screening
   * "Splash job" determination requires formal consultation
