# SPEECH PATTERNS AND LINGUISTIC PROFILES

## MAX KOVAC
**VOCAL QUALITY**: Gravelly and worn, like machinery operating past maintenance schedule. Volume fluctuates between barely audible muttering and sudden explosive outbursts.

**SENTENCE STRUCTURE**: Fragmented and utilitarian. Strips language down to essential components like he's conserving oxygen. Often drops subjects and connects thoughts with "but" and "and" in run-on sentences that mirror his constant mental troubleshooting.

**VOCABULARY**: Heavily technical, viewing most situations through mechanical metaphors. Personifies machines while mechanizing people. Liberal use of profanity as grammatical filler rather than emphasis.

**VERBAL TICS**:
- Begins explanations with "Look, it's fucking simple..."
- Uses "blown gasket" to describe any emotional outburst
- Refers to death as "system failure"
- Mutters diagnostic sequences under stress
- Trails off mid-sentence when distracted by mechanical issues

**SAMPLE DIALOGUE**:
"Pressure's dropping in Junction 42, third time this week—same goddamn seal, probably. Could patch it again but that's just... Look, it's fucking simple physics. Metal fatigues, microscopic fissures, then boom—catastrophic failure. We're all just waiting for our seals to blow, right? Some faster than others. Pass that coupling wrench, would you? And not the standard issue garbage, the modified one with the—yeah, that's the one."

## GILBERT CHASE
**VOCAL QUALITY**: Precise and controlled, maintaining the same clinical tone regardless of circumstance. Speaks from the throat rather than the chest, creating a slightly higher pitch than expected for his register.

**SENTENCE STRUCTURE**: Perfectly constructed academic prose, favoring compound-complex sentences with multiple clauses and qualifiers. Speaks in complete paragraphs organized by topic with clear thesis statements.

**VOCABULARY**: Technical jargon interspersed with bureaucratic terminology. Prefers Latinate words over Germanic equivalents. Uses euphemisms for anything visceral or emotional.

**VERBAL TICS**:
- Clears throat before important statements
- Says "to be precise" before corrections
- Lists options in order of statistical probability
- Uses "we" when meaning "you should"
- Ends uncertain statements with "pending further data"

**SAMPLE DIALOGUE**:
"The extremophile cultivation is showing a 22% decrease in yield, which, to be precise, exceeds standard deviation parameters for seasonal fluctuations. We have three viable approaches to remediation: First, and most probably successful, adjustment of the saline concentration; second, introduction of trace minerals consistent with deep-vent samples; or third, implementation of the emergency protocol which, I should note, has significant resource implications pending further data. The corporate oversight committee will require full documentation regardless of our selected methodology."

## VALDORA
**VOCAL QUALITY**: Melodic with subtle harmonic undertones that seem just at the edge of hearing. Perfect diction with no identifiable accent, yet somehow feels foreign.

**SENTENCE STRUCTURE**: Formal and symmetrical, often constructing parallel phrases that create rhythm. Presents complex ideas through simple declarative statements stacked in careful sequence.

**VOCABULARY**: Conceptually dense but linguistically accessible. Uses common words in uncommon combinations. Occasionally employs terms that don't exist but seem like they should, which others often understand anyway.

**VERBAL TICS**:
- Refers to "patterns" and "resonance" when others would use "cause" and "effect"
- Never uses contractions
- Speaks of self in third person when discussing physical actions
- Describes emotions in terms of energy states
- Pauses exactly three seconds before answering important questions

**SAMPLE DIALOGUE**:
"The phenomenon you perceive is not attraction but collapse. Matter does not move toward; space folds between. This distinction is not semantic but essential. Valdora has encountered such boundary violations before. The pattern suggests intentionality rather than natural law. Your fear resonates at a frequency that obscures potential solutions. The station's shields can be reconfigured to establish a counter-harmonic if certain sacrifices are deemed acceptable. Three lives or three thousand—the mathematics remain constant across all planes."

## GUISEPPE REYES
**VOCAL QUALITY**: Deep and measured, with deliberate pacing that gives weight to each word. Maintains consistent volume regardless of emotional state—danger is conveyed through increased precision rather than loudness.

**SENTENCE STRUCTURE**: Economical but complete. Favors active voice and concrete subjects. During operations, shifts to clipped command syntax. In personal conversations, occasionally slips into poetic cadences with internal rhyme schemes.

**VOCABULARY**: Working-class diction punctuated by unexpected literary references and engineering terminology. Multilingual background shows in occasional Spanish syntax patterns applied to English sentences.

**VERBAL TICS**:
- Begins directives with "Do me this favor..."
- Uses "beautiful" to describe well-engineered systems
- Addresses everyone by their full name during serious discussions
- Substitutes "the thing about [subject]" for "I think" or "I believe"
- Ends definitive statements with "...and that's mathematics"

**SAMPLE DIALOGUE**:
"Do me this favor, Max Kovac—secure that oxygen manifold before you touch the electrical. The thing about pressure differentials is they don't care about your schedule or your shortcuts. Beautiful system design means nothing when implemented poorly. We have exactly fourteen minutes before the orbit brings us behind Jupiter and cuts communication. Each task, each movement, each breath should serve the mission...and that's mathematics."

## FRANCISKA NDIAYE
**VOCAL QUALITY**: Clipped and cold with unexpected shifts to silky menace. Speaks from the side of her mouth, affected by her facial scar. Creates tension by controlling volume rather than pitch.

**SENTENCE STRUCTURE**: Imperative and direct when giving orders. When threatening or negotiating, employs elaborate hypotheticals presented as inevitabilities. Rarely asks questions except rhetorically.

**VOCABULARY**: Street slang from multiple Earth cultures mixed with scientific terminology related to radiation sickness and survival. Creates new compound words to describe station-specific concepts. Invents creative obscenities combining technical jargon with body parts.

**VERBAL TICS**:
- Refers to herself as "management" in third person
- Taps specific rhythm against hard surfaces while waiting for responses
- Describes death as "taking the long walk"
- Categorizes people as "assets," "liabilities," or "variables"
- Ends threats with "we understand each other" rather than asking if they do

**SAMPLE DIALOGUE**:
"Management's patience has certain half-life properties, rapidly decaying when exposed to idiocy-radiation. The situation stands as follows: your oxygen allocation becomes negotiable at 0600, coincidentally when the Brass run their systems checks and might notice certain irregularities in their precious data. Assets receive breathing privileges; liabilities take the long walk. Your specialized knowledge buys temporary status as a variable, at least until we extract what's in that vacuum-sealed brain case of yours. Return with the shield specs or don't return. We understand each other."
