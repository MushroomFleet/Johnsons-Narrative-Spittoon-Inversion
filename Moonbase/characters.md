# CHARACTER MANIFEST: IO OUTPOST DELTA-9

## MAX KOVAC
**AGE**: 42
**DESCRIPTION**: Wiry but strong, perpetually stubbled, with radiation burns along his neck he doesn't bother to hide. His once-regulation jumpsuit has been modified with extra pockets, makeshift tools, and patches from equipment long since cannibalized. His eyes are bloodshot but alert, constantly scanning for potential failures or threats.

**BACKGROUND**: Former corporate mechanic whose contract expired three years ago. Refused evacuation due to "unfinished business"—the truth is he caused an accident that killed four people, and Earth has a warrant waiting. Now works freelance, accepting payment in booze, ration credits, and radiation meds.

**PERSONALITY**: Cynical, self-destructive, yet possessing a reluctant moral compass that keeps reasserting itself despite his best efforts to drown it. Believes everyone is ultimately out for themselves, yet can't help fixing things others have given up on—machines or people.

**QUIRKS**: 
- Talks to machinery as if it's sentient
- Constantly checks radiation badge then ignores its readings
- Has memorized every breach point in the station's history
- Collects small mechanical parts that he claims "might be useful someday"
- Carries a metal flask with actual Earth whiskey that he never drinks but uses as barter for truly desperate situations

**ROLE**: The unwilling protagonist thrust into the center of the crisis when he discovers evidence of The Great Attractor's manifestation while repairing external sensors. His intimate knowledge of the station's infrastructure makes him the only one capable of implementing whatever desperate plan emerges.

**RADIATION LEVEL**: 78 jovs (terminal, being managed with black market meds)

## GILBERT CHASE
**AGE**: 33
**DESCRIPTION**: Slight build with delicate features, meticulous in appearance despite resource limitations. Always dressed in a perfectly maintained science division uniform that seems too clean for the environment. Movements are precise, almost birdlike. No visible radiation symptoms thanks to privileged access to protection.

**BACKGROUND**: Officially a mid-level xenobiology researcher studying Io's extremophile bacteria. In reality, a corporate spy evaluating the station's value now that the Jupiter catastrophe is imminent. Has been sending encrypted reports recommending abandonment of the facility without evacuation to save costs.

**PERSONALITY**: Outwardly timid and analytical, concealing a calculating opportunist. Views human lives, including his own, as variables in equations. Genuinely brilliant in his field but emotionally stunted, unable to form connections except through transactional relationships.

**QUIRKS**:
- Takes obsessively detailed notes on everything
- Cannot stand physical contact
- Washes hands exactly 16 times daily
- Creates elaborate paper models of molecular structures during downtime
- Secretly hoards real coffee beans

**ROLE**: The wildcard whose scientific knowledge becomes crucial when The Great Attractor's nature is revealed. His moral awakening (or lack thereof) will determine whether his skills aid salvation or doom.

**RADIATION LEVEL**: 12 jovs (well within safety limits)

## VALDORA
**AGE**: Unknown (appears 35)
**DESCRIPTION**: Striking androgynous figure with copper-toned skin and unusual amber eyes that seem to reflect light differently depending on the angle. Wears practical clothing augmented with unexplained materials that resemble liquid metal. A circular tattoo on the back of both hands occasionally seems to shift patterns when not directly observed.

**BACKGROUND**: Presents as a specialized radiation engineer recently transferred from Europa Station. In reality, a "planeswalker"—a being capable of traveling between dimensional planes—who has been drawn to this reality by The Great Attractor's unprecedented manifestation. Comes from a civilization that has encountered and successfully repelled similar incursions.

**PERSONALITY**: Intensely observant and methodical, with an unnerving ability to predict mechanical and human behavior. Operates from alien moral framework that prioritizes cosmic balance over individual lives. Struggles to understand human emotional attachments but is developing unexpected empathy for the station inhabitants.

**QUIRKS**:
- Never seems affected by temperature changes
- Can identify materials by taste
- Sometimes responds to questions before they're asked
- Collects discarded personal items from others without explanation
- Speaks in perfectly formed sentences with never a misspoken word

**ROLE**: The mentor figure with critical knowledge of The Great Attractor but limited understanding of human constraints and psychology. Must work through human proxies to implement countermeasures.

**RADIATION LEVEL**: Immune (body actually absorbs radiation without harm)

## GUISEPPE REYES
**AGE**: 38
**DESCRIPTION**: Mountain of a man, 6'7" with shoulders that barely fit through standard doorways. Dark complexion with a meticulously groomed beard. Despite his size, moves with surprising grace in zero-G environments. Right arm is a high-end prosthetic with custom modifications for industrial work.

**BACKGROUND**: Former orbital construction specialist who came to Io for the hazard pay five years ago. Lost his arm during an emergency repair following volcanic activity. Now runs cargo operations between the surface mining sites and the station, commanding respect from both Brass and Rats alike through sheer competence and fairness.

**PERSONALITY**: Philosophically calm exterior hides carefully regulated rage at corporate exploitation. Lives by a personal code that values skill, honesty, and direct confrontation over politicking. Forms deep but unstated loyalties to those who prove themselves useful or principled.

**QUIRKS**:
- Recites poetry from memory during crisis situations
- Keeps a small terrarium of Earth plants
- Never sits with his back to a door
- Compulsively tests and retests his prosthetic arm's calibration
- Carves intricate miniatures from scrap metal

**ROLE**: The capable enforcer whose physical strength and station-wide respect become crucial when systems begin failing and panic sets in. His network of relationships throughout all social strata provides vital connections.

**RADIATION LEVEL**: 35 jovs (showing early symptoms but functioning well)

## FRANCISKA NDIAYE
**AGE**: 47
**DESCRIPTION**: Compact, muscular build with a shaved head covered in navigational tattoos mapping Io's surface features. Face bears a prominent scar from forehead to jaw on the left side. Wears salvaged pressure suit components at all times, ready for rapid deployment.

**BACKGROUND**: Former corporate security officer who "went native" after witnessing the Brass sacrifice an entire mining team to protect proprietary technology during an eruption event. Now leads the Rats, controlling Lower Deck through strategic resource allocation and merciless enforcement of her own brand of justice.

**PERSONALITY**: Brutally pragmatic with a vindictive streak toward authority figures. Forms no attachments but values useful skills. Sees the station as a zero-sum game for survival and has no qualms about sacrificing the few for the many—as long as she decides who constitutes "the few."

**QUIRKS**:
- Collects ears from those who betray her
- Communicates complex plans through an improvised sign language
- Maintains a detailed mental map of every crawlspace and maintenance tunnel
- Tests newcomers by offering them poisoned food to see if they're observant enough to notice
- Sleeps exactly 4 hours per day, never consecutive

**ROLE**: The antagonist-turned-ally whose control over the station's underclass becomes essential when conventional authority structures collapse in the face of The Great Attractor's manifestation. Her willingness to make horrific choices creates both solutions and new problems.

**RADIATION LEVEL**: 62 jovs (advanced symptoms managed through stolen experimental treatments)
