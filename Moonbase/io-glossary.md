# GLOSSARY OF TERMS: IO OUTPOST DELTA-9

## RADIATION TERMINOLOGY

**JOV** - Unit of radiation exposure specific to Jupiter's radiation environment. Approximately 5 times more damaging than a Sievert due to unique particle composition in Jupiter's magnetosphere. "He's carrying 45 jovs, he's walking dead already."

**BADGE-JUMPER** - Person who frequently swaps radiation badges to distribute recorded exposure. "Mika's been badge-jumping for months, no wonder her hair's falling out while her dosimeter reads green."

**GLOW-UP** - Visible symptoms of radiation poisoning, particularly the distinctive mottled skin patterns. "His neck's got a serious glow-up; he won't make another quarter."

**JUPITER'S KISS** - Terminal radiation poisoning with characteristic blisters around the mouth and eyes. "Poor Hendricks got Jupiter's Kiss after that breach. Mercy they shipped him out."

**HALO** - The faint luminescence sometimes visible around highly exposed individuals in low light. "You can see his halo in the maintenance tunnels—don't stand too close for long."

**RAD-FLUSH** - Black market treatment that temporarily suppresses radiation symptoms. "He's functioning on rad-flush but his organs are basically soup by now."

**CLEAN PASS** - Coveted medical certification of low radiation exposure, required for certain privileges. "She's maintained a clean pass for two years—must have brass connections."

**COOKING** - The sensation of acute radiation exposure. "That last EVA had me cooking even through the shield suit."

**HOT ZONE** - Area with particularly high radiation levels, either due to station location or recent activity. "The south quadrant became a hot zone after that last solar event."

**SHELF-LIFE** - Estimated time before radiation exposure becomes terminal. "With those readouts, his shelf-life's about three months."

**THE DANCE** - Visible interaction between Io's volcanic plumes and Jupiter's magnetic field, creating spectacular light shows. "Caught a magnificent Dance last night—worth the extra jov exposure to see it from the observation blister."

**BLACK DRIFT** - Unexplained shadow patterns that move against light sources during certain orbital alignments. "Black Drift's heavy in Section 12; some techs refuse to enter alone."

**THE PULSE** - Fluctuation in local gravity and electronics that accompanies major tidal stresses. "Systems glitched during the Pulse; had to hard restart life support."

**SWALLOWER** - Geological formation that appears to consume matter, likely sink holes or lava tubes. "Lost two crawlers to a Swallower that wasn't on the maps."

**GHOST LIGHT** - Static electricity phenomena visible on the surface during certain conditions. "Ghost lights led them three kilometers off course before they realized they weren't following the guide beacons."

**THE LOUD ZONE** - Area where Jupiter's radio emissions make communication impossible. "We'll lose contact when they enter the Loud Zone around 1500 hours."

**IO'S BREATH** - Volcanic gas venting unpredictably from surface fissures. "Io's Breath melted through his suit before he could react."

## GREAT ATTRACTOR PHENOMENA

**THE PULL** - Subtle gravitational anomaly felt psychologically before instruments can detect it. "He felt the Pull three days before sensors confirmed the shift."

**SHIMMER** - Visual distortion associated with Great Attractor-influenced spaces. "There's a Shimmer around the sample; don't touch it without full protection."

**ECHO MOMENTS** - Temporal anomaly where events appear to repeat slightly differently. "Had an Echo Moment during maintenance—saw myself entering the chamber before I actually did."

**GRAVITY WELL** - Localized increase in gravitational pull, sometimes appearing temporarily. "The Gravity Well manifested in Section 7, crushed everything in storage to half-size."

**THE FOLD** - Theoretical spacetime distortion caused by Great Attractor. "If the models are right, The Fold will reach Jupiter's core within six months."

**ATTRACTOR SICKNESS** - Psychological symptoms associated with proximity to anomalies, including time perception distortion and dissociation. "He's showing early Attractor Sickness—seeing patterns where there aren't any."

**JUPITER SHRIEK** - Anomalous radio emission at increasing frequency as Great Attractor influences Jupiter. "The Jupiter Shriek hit a new pitch yesterday; communications had to develop new filtering algorithms."

**NULL SPACE** - Areas where normal physical laws appear suspended. "The tool floated in Null Space, neither falling nor responding to magnetic fields."

**CONVERGENCE POINT** - Location where multiple anomalies intersect, creating unpredictable effects. "They're mapping the Convergence Point but instruments fail within twenty meters."
