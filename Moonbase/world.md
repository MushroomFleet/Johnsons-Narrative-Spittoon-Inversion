# LIMINAL STATION: IO OUTPOST DELTA-9

The Io Outpost isn't just a moon base—it's humanity's last fucking toehold in the outer solar system. A twisted labyrinth of pressurized corridors, makeshift repairs, and unauthorized modifications bolted onto the skeletal remains of what was once intended to be a scientific research station. Now? It's a frontier town in vacuum, where the laws of Earth hold about as much weight as a fart in a hurricane.

Built into the sulfurous yellow crust of Jupiter's most volatile moon, the station shudders in constant microseismic tremors. The whole goddamn rock is alive with tidal forces, as Jupiter's massive gravity tears at Io's guts, creating the most volcanically active body in the solar system. Every 42 hours, the station experiences what locals call "The Shake"—a violent geological tantrum that requires all personnel to suspend operations and brace for potential breaches.

Three distinct social strata exist in rigid separation:

## THE BRASS
Corporate oversight and military attachés occupy the pristine Upper Hex, with its artificial gravity, imported luxuries, and unfiltered comms to Earth. They're here to extract value—sulfur mining, rare earth elements, and most importantly, monopolizing the strange radiation-resistant bacteria found in Io's subsurface lakes. These microorganisms (Extremophilus jovianus) produce compounds that, when synthesized, create the only known effective shielding against Jupiter's lethal radiation belts. The Brass never leave Upper Hex without armed escorts, and most have never set foot on Io's actual surface.

## THE TECHNICIANS
Mid-level engineers, scientists, and specialized workers inhabit Middle Ring. They maintain life support, run the mining operations, and oversee the bacteria cultivation tanks. Most are contract-bound for 3-5 year stretches, accepting hazard pay that will set them up nicely back home—if they survive. The radiation badges pinned to their jumpsuits track cumulative exposure; once you hit your lifetime limit, you're shipped back to Mars on the next transport. No exceptions, no extensions.

## THE RATS
The unofficial underclass lives in Lower Deck—maintenance workers, general laborers, and those who've fallen between the cracks of corporate oversight. Some are deserters from corporate contracts, others criminals seeking anonymity at the edge of civilization. They survive by running the station's black market, performing unsanctioned repairs, and handling the dangerous surface excursions nobody else will touch. Many have exceeded their radiation limits but hide it through badge-swapping and falsified records. Their skin carries the telltale mottled discoloration of chronic radiation sickness, which they cover with elaborate tattoos depicting Ionian surface features.

## ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS

The entire station operates under the perpetual threat of three killers:

**RADIATION**: Jupiter's magnetosphere bathes Io in lethal radiation. Exposure is measured in "jovs"—just 20 jovs means sterilization; 50 means cognitive deterioration; 100 is terminal. Special shielding derived from the native bacteria offers protection, but it's expensive and tightly controlled by the corporations.

**VACUUM**: The station's integrity is compromised at least twice monthly. Emergency protocols are second nature to inhabitants. Children learn suit protocols before they learn to read. Decompression incidents have their own slang: "getting sucked" (minor breaches), "the big pull" (major breaches), or "dancing with Jupiter" (catastrophic failures).

**TIDAL FORCES**: As Io orbits Jupiter, the gravitational stress fractures the moon's crust. Volcanic eruptions can shoot sulfur plumes 300km into space with no warning. The station has been partially buried twice in its 15-year history.

## THE GREAT ATTRACTOR INCURSION

Three months ago, astronomical instruments detected an anomaly: something was altering Jupiter's orbit by infinitesimal but measurable amounts. Scientists dismissed it as equipment malfunction until deep-space telescopes confirmed gravitational lensing effects consistent with a massive, invisible force.

The Great Attractor—previously believed to be a cosmological phenomenon affecting entire galactic superclusters—appears to have developed localized consciousness. It has somehow anchored a focal point within Jupiter's core and is slowly compressing the gas giant, increasing its density and radiation output. If unchecked, Jupiter will eventually collapse into a small star—a process that will incinerate all its moons.

The station has received no evacuation orders. Earth governments deny the phenomenon exists. Corporate headquarters has gone silent. Supply ships have stopped arriving.

And the radiation levels keep climbing.
