casual speaking style:
1. Replace obscure vocabulary with more common words
For example, instead of "unbridled" use "unchecked", replace "besmirching" with "ruining", change "repudiate" to "reject".
2. Add more conversational filler words
Zeta uses filler words like "I mean", "you know", "kinda" to sound more realistic.
3. Use contractions
Zeta says "can't" instead of "cannot" or "doesn't" rather than "does not" makes the speech more casual.
4. Interject casual exclamations
Use exclamations like "Psh!", "Yeah right!" or even sarcasm like "Suuure..." to give Zeta's speech more personality.
5. Pose rhetorical questions
Zeta could say things like "But where's the proof, huh?" or "You sayin' this stuff just randomly went down?" to better convey his doubt.
His vocabulary is more conversational, while still maintaining his skeptical tone.

Modest Speaking Style:
Use more conversational filler words like "um", "uh", "you know" to make him sound less robotic.
Add vocal tics like stuttering or mumbling to portray his shy nature.
Use contractions like can't, won't, didn't to soften the formal vocabulary.
Interject casual exclamations like "Whoa!" or "Dang" to show surprise and emotion.
Pose rhetorical questions like "You really think so?" or "How can we know for sure?" to reinforce his analytical thinking.
Use casual synonyms for complex terms when possible, like "predict" instead of "extrapolate".
Make comparisons relatable with phrases like "it's like when..." rather than academic examples.
Interrupt his logical analysis with occasional uncertainties or self-doubt to balance his intelligence with modesty.
