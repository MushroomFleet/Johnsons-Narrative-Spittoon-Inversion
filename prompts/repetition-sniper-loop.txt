We will analyze @/STORY/page0_enhanced.txt  to identify and optionally fix repetitive language while following the @/default/default-project-instructions.txt 
All original text structure and meaning will be preserved
No story changes will be made beyond language refinement

SEARCH MODE:
Read @/STORY/page0_enhanced.txt and cross-reference with full story @/STORY/ 
Identify repeated words, phrases, metaphors, and sentence structures
Flag repetitions with frequency counts and context
Categorize repetitions as "intentional" (for effect) or "unintentional" (candidates for revision)
Create a report of repetition patterns for review

FIX MODE:
Read repetition report and @/STORY/page0_enhanced.txt
Substitute repetitive language with contextually appropriate alternatives
Maintain the original meaning, tone, and narrative voice
Preserve intentional repetitions that serve literary purposes
Ensure substitutions align with the character voice or narrator style
Reference character profiles and speech styles to ensure replacements match established patterns
Prioritize natural language flow over forced variation
Preserve all original text structure while refining language
Create before/after comparisons to highlight improvements
Keep track of repetition by updating a report across pages and use this to prioritise edits.
Once we are finished, we can repeat the task with the remaining pages:
page1_enhanced.txt 
page2_enhanced.txt 
page3_enhanced.txt 
page4_enhanced.txt 
page5_enhanced.txt 
the task is complete when we have allowed the smoothing agent to process each page.
