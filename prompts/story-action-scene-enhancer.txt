We will enhance the @/STORY/ by enriching action scenes while following the lore define in that story
All original text, speech, and narrative will be preserved
No existing story elements will be altered
Read the full storyline to ensure narrative continuity
Where applicable maintain consistent action scene enhancement
We will process one Chapter at a time, writing a new file using the chapter name

Identify action scenes within the text (combat, chases, confrontations, physical conflicts, intense athletic performances, supernatural/magical battles)
If no action scene is detected, make no changes to the text
For identified action scenes, add dynamic enhancements that:

- Manipulate perceived time:
  * Slow down crucial moments to expand milliseconds into detailed passages
  * Accelerate mundane movements to maintain narrative momentum
  * Create contrast between hyperaware, time-dilated states and rushed, chaotic sequences
  * Use sentence length to control pacing (short, choppy sentences for intensity; longer for slow-motion)

- Intensify sensory details:
  * Auditory: heartbeats, breathing, weapon sounds, environmental acoustics, ringing ears
  * Tactile: impact forces, pain specificities, texture of weapons/objects, temperature
  * Visual: focus shifts between micro-details and wider awareness, lighting effects, color intensity
  * Olfactory/Gustatory: gunpowder, blood, sweat, dust, metallic tastes, adrenaline flavors
  * Proprioception: balance shifts, muscle tension, spatial awareness, gravitational pulls

- Enhance combat choreography and physics:
  * Track positional relationships between combatants with spatial clarity
  * Detail specific fighting techniques, weapon handling, and tactical decisions
  * Emphasize cause-effect chains of action/reaction with physical authenticity
  * Incorporate momentum, weight, and force in movement descriptions
  * Balance technical accuracy with readability and excitement

- Heighten physiological and psychological responses:
  * Internal bodily reactions: adrenaline surges, pain signals, muscle fatigue, breath control
  * Instinctive versus calculated decision-making in split-second moments
  * Tunnel vision effects versus peripheral awareness
  * Time perception distortions from the character's viewpoint
  * Emotional states intensifying or interfering with physical performance

Preserve all original text including the beginning and ending of the page
New action details should seamlessly integrate with the existing narrative flow
Enhancement should maintain the established tone and voice of the story
Balance detail with pacing:
- Create rhythmic alternation between explosive action and momentary stillness
- Use paragraph structure to control tempo (short paragraphs accelerate; longer ones decelerate)
- Load crucial moments with detail while summarizing transitional movements
- Vary information density based on the significance of the action beat
- Maintain forward momentum while expanding pivotal instances

Ensure authenticity and consistency:
- Align added descriptions with characters' established capabilities and limitations
- Respect the story's internal physics, magic systems, and technological frameworks
- Maintain character voice even during intense action
- Consider character expertise level when describing technique and awareness
- Reflect character-specific fighting styles, habits, and physical tendencies

Leverage environment as an active element:
- Transform settings into dynamic participants rather than static backdrops
- Describe how terrain, objects, weather, and lighting conditions affect the action
- Create environmental obstacles, advantages, and hazards that shape tactics
- Use setting elements for improvisational weapon opportunities
- Enhance immersion through destruction, alteration or interaction with surroundings

Focus on visceral impact:
- Prioritize concrete, sensory-rich language over abstract conceptualization
- Balance external observations with internal experiences
- Capture the messy, chaotic nature of real combat while maintaining readability
- Emphasize physical consequences (injuries, exhaustion, damage to surroundings)
- Heighten stakes by clarifying immediate dangers and potential outcomes
