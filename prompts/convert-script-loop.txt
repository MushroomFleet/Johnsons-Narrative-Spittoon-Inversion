we will create a script by reading the page, extracting the Speech and appending names to the lines in our new script.
1. read @/Johnsons-Narrative-Spittoon-Inversion/007b/page30.txt 
2. identify who is speaking by name and assign that first on each line (movie script format)
3. extract the spoken lines from the page and write them to a new text file, using "script" as a filename prefix, with a matching number to the page we are reading, saved next to the file we are reading. 
4. decrement the text filename by one to find the previous page, repeat the task for each page, one at a time.
5. the task is complete when you decrementally reach "page00.txt" and finish saving "script00.txt"
