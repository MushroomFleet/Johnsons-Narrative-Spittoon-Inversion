We will create a screenplay by reading the page, transforming the narrative text into screenplay format, and saving it as a new file.

1. Read @/Johnsons-Narrative-Spittoon-Inversion/007b/page30.txt
2. Convert the narrative text into proper screenplay format including:
   - Scene headings (INT./EXT., location, time of day)
   - Action descriptions (what's happening visually)
   - Character names in ALL CAPS before dialogue
   - Dialogue properly formatted and indented
   - Parentheticals for delivery instructions when needed
   - Transitions where appropriate
3. Save the screenplay version to a new text file, using "screenplay" as a filename prefix, with a matching number to the page we are reading, saved next to the file we are reading.
4. Decrement the text filename by one to find the previous page, repeat the task for each page, one at a time.
5. The task is complete when you decrementally reach "page00.txt" and finish saving "screenplay00.txt"
