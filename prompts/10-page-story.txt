We will define the process methodology for this task in planning mode, then i will supply the final page of the story. we will then follow the @/Paradistro-project-instructions.txt while we:

read the @/STORY/page10.txt
understand the instructions in @/project-instructions.txt
write "page9.txt" which aims to tell the story of how we reached @/STORY/page10.txt  use the data linked in the @/Paradistro-project-instructions.txt to inform the story content.
repeat the instruction for each page until you reach the "page0.txt" which will be the start of this story.
