Choose Your Own Adventure Implementation Plan
Based on the materials I've reviewed, I'll create a comprehensive plan to implement the "Choose Your Own Adventure" system that writes stories in reverse, set in the Westwick universe.

Story Concept Overview
From examining page5.txt, I can see we have the ending of a noir detective story featuring Elijah Morales-Singh, a private investigator who has just closed a case involving lunar artifacts, a conspiracy, and some moral compromises. This will serve as our "main ending" (the Very Good or Good outcome), from which we'll work backwards to create the full branching narrative.

Step 1: Create the Story Structure Diagram
I'll design a Mermaid flowchart that maps out all story branches. This will be our blueprint for the entire narrative structure:

(example mermaid diagram)

This diagram shows:

A story with 1 starting point, branching into 8 possible endings
Each page (except final pages) offers 2 choices
Morally complex choices that reflect the noir setting
Outcomes ranging from Very Good to Very Bad based on choices
Step 2: Creating the Endings (Final Pages)
I'll determine content for all 8 endings, with the original page5.txt serving as our Page 5ABB (Good Ending - Personal Justice), where Morales-Singh keeps a piece of lunar tech as insurance.

For each variant ending, I'll create different final scenes on the walkway of The Stilts, showing how different choices led to different outcomes:

Very Good (P5AAA): Complete justice achieved, conspiracy exposed, both the dame and artifact safe, minimal personal compromise
Good (P5AAB, P5ABB, P5BBA): Partial justice with some compromise, but overall positive outcome
Neutral (P5ABA, P5BAB): Mixed results, some justice but at significant cost
Bad (P5BAA): Corporate retaliation for whistleblowing, detective's reputation damaged
Very Bad (P5BBB): Detective corrupted, evidence lost, dame endangered, case unresolved
Step 3: Building Backwards From Each Ending
For each of the 8 endings, I'll use the "because but therefore" reverse-engineering approach to write the preceding pages. For example:

Page 4ABB: Morales-Singh decided to keep evidence as insurance because he didn't fully trust the Shadow Agency but this meant withholding crucial evidence therefore he ended up with a piece of lunar tech in his pocket on the walkway.
I'll create content for each of the 15 other pages (4 at level 4, 4 at level 3, 2 at level 2, and 1 at level 1) plus the starting page (Page 0).

Step 4: Implementation of Choice Text
On each non-final page, I'll add structured choice text in this format:

You stand at the crossroads. Do you:
A) [Brave/Trust/Help option] (Turn to Page XYZ)
B) [Cautious/Doubt/Ignore option] (Turn to Page ABC)
Choices will be morally complex, reflecting the noir genre and the detective's dilemmas, without making either choice obviously "right" or "wrong."

Step 5: Applying Hero's Journey Elements in Reverse
I'll incorporate Hero's Journey elements in reverse order across the pages:

Final Pages (5): Return with Elixir (but with varying degrees of success)
Level 4 Pages: Resurrection/Transformation
Level 3 Pages: The Road Back/Reward
Level 2 Pages: Ordeal/Approach
Level 1 Page: Meeting Mentors/Crossing Threshold
Page 0: Call to Adventure/Ordinary World
Step 6: Consistent Narrative Elements
Throughout all branches, I'll maintain:

Noir detective tone and atmosphere
Consistent characterization of Elijah Morales-Singh
Westwick setting elements (flooded districts, lunar technology)
Speech patterns as defined in the SpeechStyles.json file
Consistent references to supporting characters
File Structure and Naming
Files will be organized in the STORY directory with this naming convention:

page0.txt (starting point)
page1.txt (first decision point)
page2A.txt, page2B.txt (second level pages)
page3AA.txt through page3BB.txt (third level pages)
page4AAA.txt through page4BBB.txt (fourth level pages)
page5AAA.txt through page5BBB.txt (ending pages)
Implementation Process
First, create the full mermaid diagram for visualization
Create all 8 variants of the final page (page5XXX.txt files)
Work backwards level by level (4, 3, 2, 1, 0)
Add choice text to each non-final page
Review for narrative consistency and flow
Ensure each choice has meaningful consequences
Should we move forward with this implementation plan?
