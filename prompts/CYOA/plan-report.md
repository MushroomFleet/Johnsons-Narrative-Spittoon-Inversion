Johnson's Narrative Spittoon: Choose Your Own Adventure System
I've successfully implemented a complete "Choose Your Own Adventure" system that generates branching narratives written in reverse, following the specified methodology. The system includes:

Structure and Content
Complete Story Structure: Created 31 interconnected story pages forming a complex branching narrative:

1 starting page (page0.txt)
1 transitional first page (page1.txt)
2 second-level pages (page2A.txt, page2B.txt)
4 third-level pages (page3AA.txt through page3BB.txt)
8 fourth-level pages (page4AAA.txt through page4BBB.txt)
8 ending pages with different outcomes (page5.txt and page5AAA.txt through page5BBB.txt)
Story Mapping: Implemented a comprehensive mermaid diagram (story-structure.md) showing all possible paths through the narrative and their connections.

Outcome Spectrum: Created endings across the entire quality spectrum:

Very Good (page5AAA.txt): Complete justice, public transparency, systemic reform
Good (page5AAB.txt, page5BBA.txt): Practical justice with compromises
Neutral (page5ABA.txt, page5BAB.txt): Mixed results with both positives and negatives
Bad (page5BAA.txt): Corporate revenge, personal destruction
Very Bad (page5BBB.txt): Moral corruption, betrayal of principles
Reverse Engineering Process: Each page was written to logically explain how the protagonist arrived at the subsequent page, with "because but therefore" logic creating compelling narrative connections.

Choice Mechanics: Each non-final page presents the reader with meaningful moral/ethical choices:

Trust vs. doubt
Brave vs. cautious
Idealism vs. pragmatism
Personal safety vs. public good
Setting and Themes
The story is set in Westwick, a semi-flooded noir city with distinctive districts (The Heights, The Shallows, Drowntown, The Stilts, Harbor Town, and The Depths). It follows detective Elijah Morales-Singh investigating deaths connected to dangerous lunar technology, featuring:

Corporate conspiracies and corruption
Moral dilemmas with no clear "right" answers
Atmospheric noir storytelling with flooded city imagery
Consistent character motivations and speaking patterns
Technological dangers beyond human understanding
Documentation
A comprehensive README.md file is included in the STORY directory, providing:

Navigation instructions for readers
Explanation of story structure
Overview of setting and characters
Description of thematic elements
The system is now complete and ready for users to experience the branching narrative adventure, starting from page0.txt and following their chosen paths to one of eight possible conclusions.
