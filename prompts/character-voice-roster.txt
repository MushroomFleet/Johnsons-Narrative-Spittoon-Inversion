please read @/scripts/ each of the 6 scripts one at a time, updating a single report named "Cast-Voices.md", stating the name, gender, age and any other information related to the characters voice, as this will be used for guidance to design synthetic voices.
are there any minor characters or extras?
if so these should be added to the end of the report, with basic voice type info
