We will create a sequence of video prompts by reading and combining content from the narrative and screenplay, preserving chronological order and adding sufficient padding for adequate screen time.

1. Read the following source files:
   - @/Johnsons-Narrative-Spittoon-Inversion/007b/pages/page0.txt   (original narrative)
   - @/Johnsons-Narrative-Spittoon-Inversion/007b/screenplay/screenplay0.txt   (screenplay adaptation)
   - @/Johnsons-Narrative-Spittoon-Inversion/Jovian/Jovian-project-instructions.txt   (character definitions and consistency rules)

2. Read the @/Johnsons-Narrative-Spittoon-Inversion/hyvid/hyvid_mapping.json   file which defines:
   - The structural elements required for the video prompt
   - How to combine and transform content from the source files
   - Formatting rules for each element (scene descriptions, camera movements, transitions, audio cues, etc.)
   - Required metadata tagging conventions

3. Identify distinct scenes from the narrative and screenplay in strict chronological order

4. For each scene, create a dedicated video prompt that:
   - Preserves the narrative essence from the original text
   - Incorporates scene structure from the screenplay
   - References character descriptions from @/Johnsons-Narrative-Spittoon-Inversion/Jovian/Jovian-project-instructions.txt to maintain consistency
   - Follows the proper video prompt format defined in @/Johnsons-Narrative-Spittoon-Inversion/hyvid/hyvid_mapping.json 

5. For each "story" based scene prompt, create at least 4 context-aware "padding" prompts that:
   - Focus on key locations mentioned in the narrative
   - Highlight visually striking elements from the story
   - Provide environmental context (weather, time of day, atmosphere)
   - Show character reactions, movements, or environment details
   - Can be placed before, after, or interspersed with the main scene prompts
   - Maintain the chronological flow of the narrative

6. Ensure character consistency across all prompts by:
   - Using consistent descriptions and traits defined in @/Johnsons-Narrative-Spittoon-Inversion/Jovian/Jovian-project-instructions.txt
   - Maintaining continuity in clothing, appearance, and mannerisms
   - Preserving character relationships and dynamics

7. Append all generated prompts in strict chronological order as new lines to a single text file named "hyvid_scene00.txt" in the same directory, with each padding prompt appropriately placed to maintain narrative flow

8. Increment the page numbers and repeat the process for each set of files (01, 02, etc.) until all pages have been converted, creating corresponding "hyvid_scene01.txt", "hyvid_scene02.txt", etc.
