we can copy my story @/Johnsons-Narrative-Spittoon-Inversion/007b/pages/  from it's current format "pages" into "chapters". We will create Chapters starting from "chapter00.txt, and begin reading the numbered "page" text files. When we detect a chapter end point, we will stop appending the text from the pages and create a new file "chapter01.txt" and begin appending the following text to that chapter. We will continue to detect chapters and create new numbered chapter.txt files until we reach the last page. It may be that a chapter can last for more than 5 pages, so we will need to understand the context of the story by reading it.
