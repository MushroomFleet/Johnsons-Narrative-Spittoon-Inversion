[Page 5BAA: Bad Ending - Corporate Revenge]

... and in the end, the truth I exposed became the weapon used against me.

I stood on the elevated walkway of The Stilts, watching the fog roll in from the harbor. The moon hung low and heavy in the sky, its cratered surface a reminder of how much had changed since '48. My reflection wavered in the floodwaters below, distorted by the neon lights from the jazz club across the canal—a club I could no longer afford to enter.

The case was closed—and so was my agency. The lunar artifact had been returned to the Shadow Agency's vault by morning, but that small victory had come at an enormous cost. The dame was safe in The Heights, though she didn't return my calls anymore. Reputation is everything in Westwick, and mine had been systematically destroyed.

I lit my last cigarette, watching the embers glow in the perpetual mist. My fedora was worn and stained, water damage being the least of my concerns now. The wound in my side had healed poorly, a constant reminder of my miscalculation. The doctor I could afford these days worked out of a back room in The Shallows.

In my pocket, the eviction notice crinkled with every movement. Three days to clear out my office above what used to be Finnegan's Bar—now owned by a subsidiary of the very corporation I'd tried to expose. Funny how quickly property changes hands in this town when someone wants to send a message.

I'd solved the puzzle, followed the breadcrumbs from the flooded basements of the old financial district to the pristine towers of corporate power. I'd uncovered names, connections, a conspiracy that reached higher than the church spires that dominated our skyline. I'd reported everything, every damning detail to the authorities, the newspapers, anyone who would listen.

Then the counterattack began. The libel suits. The witnesses who suddenly recanted. The evidence that mysteriously vanished from police lockup. The corporate-owned newspapers painting me as a paranoid, unstable veteran with a vendetta. The clients who stopped calling. The banks that called in my loans.

A leaky rowboat pulled up to the walkway, piloted by an old friend who'd taken pity on me. One of the few who still would. The driver didn't ask where I was headed—there was only one place a man like me could go now. The Depths, where those with nowhere else lived in the abandoned upper floors of flooded buildings.

Tomorrow, I'd start over. With no name, no license, no office. Working cases for people who couldn't afford real detectives, paid in meals or favors. I'd rebuild, one waterlogged step at a time.

That's how it goes in this half-drowned city. Justice doesn't just drown—it gets held under until the bubbles stop.

I tossed my cigarette into the dark water and watched it extinguish with a soft hiss. For a moment, I wondered if the choice I'd made had been worth it. If revealing everything I knew had made any difference at all.

"Coming, Morales-Singh?" my friend called out, his voice low. "We need to be gone before the corporate security patrol comes through."

I adjusted my threadbare coat and stepped into the leaky vessel, leaving my old life on the walkway behind me. In Westwick, sometimes the truth isn't enough. Sometimes it's just another thing that sinks.

Some mysteries are solved, but the solvers rarely prosper.

And some detectives learn that in a city where money flows like water, swimming against the current can leave you drowned.

THE END
