[Page 3AB: Shadow Agency Encounter]

"Let me get this straight," I said, keeping to the shadows of the boathouse as Vera Chen watched nervously through rain-streaked windows. "Your informant claims the artifact will be moved tonight?"

Vera nodded, her scientist's hands fidgeting with the lapels of her coat. Not cut out for field work, but brave enough to be here anyway. "AeroCorp's security detail will transfer it from this boathouse to their research facility in The Heights. Quietly. No paperwork."

I'd been tracking the stolen lunar artifact for weeks, following a trail of dead researchers and frightened witnesses. Vera had been the only one with the courage to come forward, to reveal what her employers at AeroCorp were really doing with technology salvaged from the moon.

"We could confront them now," she whispered, glancing at my holstered revolver. "Stop the transfer before it happens."

I shook my head, studying the boathouse through my binoculars. "Two men inside, at least four patrolling the perimeter. Corporate muscle, well-armed. Confrontation's a last resort."

The wiser play was patience. Gather evidence of the transfer. Document the chain of custody. Build a case that would stand up in court, rather than my word against a corporate legal team.

"There," Vera pointed to a sleek amphibious vehicle approaching along the canal, its engine nearly silent. "That's their transport."

I snapped several photos with my miniature camera as two men emerged from the boathouse carrying a specialized containment case. The blue glow of the lunar artifact was visible even through its shielded casing.

That's when the night erupted in gunfire.

Black-clad figures materialized from the fog, surrounding the transport team with military precision. Not police—their movements were too practiced, their equipment too advanced. The corporate security team didn't even have time to draw weapons before they were on the ground, subdued.

"Shadow Agency," I whispered. The government's deniable assets, hunting the same prize we were.

One of the agents retrieved the containment case, securing it with practiced efficiency. Another spoke into a wrist communicator, words lost in the distance.

Vera clutched my arm. "If they take it, all our evidence—"

"Stay here," I said, making a split-second decision. "If this goes sideways, someone needs to know what happened."

Before she could protest, I slipped from our hiding place, using the shadows and rain to approach the scene. Not to confront them—that would be suicide—but to overhear, to understand.

"Confirmed acquisition," the lead agent was saying. "Preparing for transport to secure facility."

Another agent, tall and lean, consulted a tablet. "Sir, mission parameters included surveillance for secondary targets. We have movement at the southern perimeter."

They'd spotted Vera. Or me. Either way, our window was closing fast.

I needed to make a choice. I could retreat now, preserving what little evidence we had but losing track of the artifact. Or I could follow the Shadow Agency team, possibly discovering where they were taking the lunar tech, but risking capture—or worse.

A sound behind me. I turned to find myself staring into the impassive face of a Shadow Agency operative, weapon raised.

"Detective Morales-Singh," he said, my name sounding strange in his clinical tone. "Your reputation precedes you. The Agency would like a word."

Twenty minutes later, I sat in the back of an unmarked vehicle with tinted windows, the containment case secured between two silent agents. The leader—who had introduced himself only as Phillips—studied me with calculated interest.

"Your investigation has been... persistent," he said finally. "And increasingly problematic."

"Three people are dead," I replied evenly. "AeroCorp is illegally experimenting with lunar technology. Someone needs to be held accountable."

Phillips nodded. "On that much, we agree. Where we differ is methodology." He tapped the containment case. "This artifact contains technology beyond current scientific understanding. In the wrong hands—"

"Like AeroCorp's?"

"Precisely." His smile was thin. "The Shadow Agency exists to contain such threats. To manage situations the public isn't prepared to handle."

"And cover up corporate crimes in the process?"

Phillips didn't rise to the bait. "We're offering you a chance to be part of the solution, detective. The Agency could use someone with your... moral clarity. Or you can continue your investigation alone, against forces you barely comprehend."

I studied the man, weighing options. The Agency had resources I could only dream of. Access to evidence that could crack the case wide open. But they played by their own rules, answerable to no one.

"What exactly are you proposing?" I asked.

"A partnership of convenience. You help us secure all fragments of the lunar technology. We give you access to our intelligence on AeroCorp's operation." Phillips extended his hand. "Do we have an arrangement?"

You stand at the crossroads. Do you:
A) Trust the Shadow Agency with the investigation (Turn to Page 4ABA)
B) Keep some evidence hidden as personal insurance (Turn to Page 4ABB)
