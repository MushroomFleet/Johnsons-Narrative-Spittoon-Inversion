... and in the end, the truth came to light, clear as the rare cloudless day in Westwick.

I stood on the elevated walkway of The Stilts, watching the fog roll in from the harbor. The moon hung low and heavy in the sky, its cratered surface a reminder of how much had changed since '48. My reflection wavered in the floodwaters below, distorted by the neon lights from the jazz club across the canal.

The case was closed—officially and truly. The lunar artifact would be displayed in the city museum by morning, a symbol of transparency in a town built on secrets. The Shadow Agency's involvement had been documented and disclosed, their off-books operation now facing proper oversight. The dame was safe in The Heights, installed in a new position where she could monitor the reforms we'd set in motion.

I lit a cigarette, watching the embers glow in the perpetual mist. My fedora was still damp from the chase through The Shallows, water damage being an occupational hazard in this town. The wound in my side had stopped bleeding, but the doctor said I'd feel it when the winter came. Some prices are worth paying.

In my pocket, I fingered the badge they'd offered me—a position on the special commission overseeing lunar artifact regulation. Legitimacy, I told myself. Accountability, maybe. An opportunity to ensure what I'd uncovered wouldn't happen again.

I'd solved the puzzle, followed the breadcrumbs from the flooded basements of the old financial district to the pristine towers of corporate power. I'd uncovered names, connections, a conspiracy that reached higher than the church spires that dominated our skyline. And for once in this town, the evidence had been impossible to bury or ignore.

The morning papers would run the full story—names and all. The corporations would answer for their secret labs beneath Harbor Town. The corrupt cops would be swept out like the tide. Even the mayor was facing uncomfortable questions about certain campaign contributions.

The amphibious cab pulled up to the walkway, water sloshing against its modified chassis. The driver tipped his hat in recognition—news traveled fast in Westwick. "City Hall or the press conference, Mr. Morales-Singh?" he called out.

I took a deep breath of the damp air. The city smelled different somehow. Not perfect, not clean, but... hopeful. Like rain washing away months of grime.

Tomorrow, the real work would begin. Building something better on the foundations we'd exposed. Ensuring the technology from the moon would benefit more than just the wealthy in The Heights. Maybe even finding ways to reclaim parts of The Depths.

That's how change happens in this half-drowned city. Not all at once, but inch by inch, like the waters that rose to claim The Depths in the first place.

I tossed my cigarette into the dark water and watched it extinguish with a soft hiss. For a moment, I smiled, thinking about the choice I'd made to see this through. The lines I'd refused to cross.

"City Hall," I told the cabbie, settling into the back seat. "There's still work to be done."

In Westwick, you learn to live with the choices you make. Today, mine sat comfortably on my shoulders.

Some mysteries are solved not just by finding answers, but by making sure those answers matter.

And some detectives learn that swimming against the current is what changes its course.

THE END
