[Page 3AA: The Chase]

"Behind you!" Vera Chen shouted from the doorway of the abandoned warehouse.

I ducked just as a crowbar whistled through the air where my head had been. The attacker—a burly man in a corporate security uniform—recovered quickly, resetting his stance for another swing. Not your average hired muscle. Military training, from the looks of it.

"Forget the detective," called another voice from deeper in the warehouse. "Grab the artifact and run!"

The narrow beam of my flashlight caught a glimpse of someone in expensive shoes sprinting toward the back exit, clutching what could only be the lunar artifact we'd been tracking for weeks. The same artifact that had gotten three people killed already.

I sidestepped the crowbar man's next swing and delivered a solid right hook to his jaw. He staggered back, giving me the opening I needed to pursue the real prize.

"Vera, call the DA's office!" I shouted over my shoulder as I sprinted into the darkness after the fleeing figure. "Tell them we've got a connection to AeroCorp!"

The warehouse opened onto the canals of The Shallows, where the perpetual two feet of water had transformed the old industrial district into a maze of elevated walkways and makeshift bridges. Perfect for someone trying to disappear.

I caught sight of my quarry leaping onto a waiting motor skiff. Corporate type, from the suit and the manicured hands. He shouted something to the driver, who gunned the engine.

No time for caution. I ran full-tilt along the slippery walkway and launched myself toward the departing boat. My hands found the gunwale, nearly slipping off the wet metal before I secured my grip. The skiff lurched as the driver spotted me, attempting to shake me loose.

The corporate man looked down at me, his face contorted with panic. Not used to getting his hands dirty. "Just let go, detective," he said, his refined accent contrasting with the desperation in his voice. "This is bigger than you understand."

"Try me," I grunted, pulling myself up despite the driver's attempts to shake me.

The man's expression hardened. He reached into his jacket—going for a weapon. I released one hand from the gunwale to block him, nearly slipping into the dark water below.

In the struggle, something fell from his inner pocket. The lunar artifact—a small cylinder glowing with an unnatural blue light—skittered across the deck of the skiff.

The boat took a sharp turn, slamming us both against the side. I used the momentum to haul myself fully aboard, tackling the corporate man as he lunged for the artifact. We crashed into the control console, sending the driver tumbling into the canal.

The skiff, now pilotless, accelerated toward the concrete wall of an underpass. No time to reach the controls.

"Jump!" I yelled, grabbing the artifact in one quick motion and launching myself over the side.

The cold, fetid water of The Shallows engulfed me as behind us, the skiff exploded against the concrete in a ball of flame and debris. The force of the blast pushed me underwater, disorienting me in the murky darkness.

When I surfaced, gasping, I still clutched the artifact in one hand. The corporate man was nowhere to be seen.

Back on a walkway ten minutes later, dripping wet and nursing what would develop into impressive bruises, I examined our prize as Vera joined me.

"That's really it?" she asked, her eyes reflecting the artifact's blue glow. "The missing piece of lunar tech the Shadow Agency's been hunting?"

I nodded, running my thumb over strange markings on its surface. "And worth killing for, apparently." I pocketed the device. "Question is, what do we do now?"

The wail of sirens approached—police or corporate security, hard to tell the difference some days in Westwick. We had evidence, we had the artifact, we had a direct connection to AeroCorp. But we also had powerful enemies now, enemies who wouldn't hesitate to bury the truth along with us.

"We need to get this to someone we can trust," Vera said, wiping rain from her face. Or maybe it was canal water. In The Shallows, it was often hard to tell the difference. "But who?"

You stand at the crossroads. Do you:
A) Take the moral high road and bring everything to the District Attorney (Turn to Page 4AAA)
B) Strike a compromise with corporate leadership for greater good (Turn to Page 4AAB)
