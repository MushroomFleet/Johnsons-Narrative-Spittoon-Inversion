The rain fell in a steady rhythm against the window of my second-floor office, mixing with the distant jazz from Finnegan's Bar below. I hung my dampened fedora on the rack by the door and poured two fingers of whiskey into a glass that had seen better days—much like its owner.

Elijah Morales-Singh, Private Investigator. That's what it said on the door, at least. Former military engineer, ex-cop, now scraping a living from the troubled waters of Westwick. The city had changed since the failed tidal engineering project of '46 and the unexpected moon landing of '48. Half-flooded, divided by water and wealth, caught between the old world and whatever strange future the lunar discoveries promised.

I glanced at the stack of unpaid bills on my desk. Work had been slow lately—a few insurance investigations, a missing person case that turned out to be a spouse who'd simply had enough. Nothing that would keep the lights on for much longer.

The whiskey burned pleasantly as I settled into my chair and reached for the newspaper. The headline caught my eye: "AeroCorp Researcher Found Dead, Third in Two Weeks." Below that, a smaller article: "Lunar Technology Division Announces Breakthrough, Stock Surges."

I knew AeroCorp by reputation—one of the aerospace giants that had capitalized on the space race, now diversified into everything from transportation to experimental energy research. Their tower dominated the skyline of The Heights, far above the waterline and the problems of ordinary citizens.

Three dead researchers was unusual, even for a city where death came in many forms. Drownings in The Depths, territorial disputes in Drowntown, corporate "accidents" that kept the powerful safe from scandal. But three from the same company, same division? That wasn't coincidence. That was pattern.

I was still studying the article when my office phone rang. The old rotary, not my personal line. Few people had that number anymore.

I hesitated, then picked up. "Morales-Singh Investigations."

"Detective," a woman's voice, tense but controlled. "My name is Maya Chen. I'm—I was—a colleague of the men mentioned in today's paper."

My interest sharpened. "The AeroCorp scientists?"

"Yes." A pause, the sound of movement, as if she was checking her surroundings. "I can't talk long. But I need help. Those deaths weren't accidents, and I believe I'm next."

"What makes you think that?"

"Because I know what they discovered. About the lunar artifact." Her voice dropped lower. "It's not what AeroCorp claims. It's more dangerous—and more valuable. People are willing to kill for it."

"Ms. Chen—"

"I can pay," she interrupted. "Not much, but something. And I have evidence. Names. Records." Another pause. "Will you help me, detective? Before I end up like the others?"

The rain intensified outside, drumming against the glass. I looked again at the bills, at the newspaper with its neatly sanitized corporate press release about "tragic accidents."

Three dead scientists. A potentially valuable lunar artifact. A desperate woman with evidence of something worth killing for. And me, a detective with more month than money, but also with the engineering background to understand whatever technological puzzle was at the center of this.

I took another sip of whiskey and made my decision.

"Where can we meet?"

You stand at the crossroads. Do you:
A) Meet Maya Chen for a confidential discussion (Turn to Page 1)
B) Report the suspicious call to AeroCorp for a potential reward (Turn to Page 1)
