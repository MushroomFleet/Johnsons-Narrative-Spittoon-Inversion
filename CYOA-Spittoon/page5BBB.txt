[Page 5BBB: Very Bad Ending - Lost in Corruption]

... and in the end, I became what I had hunted, my soul as submerged as The Depths.

I stood on the elevated walkway of The Stilts, watching the fog roll in from the harbor. The moon hung low and heavy in the sky, its cratered surface a reminder of how much had changed since '48. My reflection wavered in the floodwaters below, distorted by the neon lights from the jazz club across the canal, unrecognizable even to myself.

The case was closed—buried, more accurately. The lunar artifact was secured in my personal safe, not the Shadow Agency's vault where it belonged. The dame... I prefer not to think about her fate in Drowntown. Some doors shouldn't be opened. Some choices can't be unmade.

I lit a cigarette, watching the embers glow in the perpetual mist. My new fedora remained pristine despite the damp air, water damage no longer being a concern for a man of my position. The wound in my side had been treated by the corporate doctor, who assured me the experimental lunar healing tech would leave no scar. No physical ones, anyway.

In my pocket, the business card of the corporate executive felt slick between my fingers. A permanent position, they'd said. Security consultant with certain "discretionary authorities." The money was better than I'd ever dreamed. The power was intoxicating.

I'd solved the puzzle, followed the breadcrumbs from the flooded basements of the old financial district to the pristine towers of corporate power. I'd uncovered names, connections, a conspiracy that reached higher than the church spires that dominated our skyline. Then I'd taken their offer instead of exposing them.

The sleek private water limousine pulled up to the walkway, barely disturbing the dark water with its silent engine. The driver didn't ask where I was headed—there was only one place a man like me belonged now. The Heights, where the corporate towers gleamed above the fog and the water never reached.

Tomorrow, I'd attend my first board meeting. Advise on which investigators were getting too close, which journalists needed to be silenced with money or more permanent methods. I'd help bury evidence deeper than The Depths themselves. I'd become the shadow I once tried to illuminate.

That's how it goes in this half-drowned city. Principles dissolve like sugar in rain. Integrity rusts like the abandoned cars in The Shallows.

I tossed my cigarette into the dark water and watched it extinguish with a soft hiss. There was no point contemplating the choices I'd made. The lines I'd crossed. The people I'd sacrificed.

"Evening, Mr. Morales-Singh," the driver called out with practiced deference. "The executive committee is waiting."

I adjusted my tailored coat and stepped into the vehicle, leaving the last fragments of my former self on the walkway behind me. In Westwick, you either drown in your principles or learn to float on corruption.

Some mysteries aren't meant to be solved. Some secrets are too profitable to expose.

And some detectives discover that swimming with the current is easier than fighting against it—especially when that current is lined with lunar gold.

THE END
