"Dr. Lagos needs to see you immediately," the security guard said, his expression unreadable behind reflective glasses. "Fifty-third floor."

I'd spent the morning cataloging evidence in Dr. Chen's secret records—names, dates, experimental logs that documented not just the death of three researchers, but the deliberate coverup orchestrated by AeroCorp's executive team. The assistant who'd shown me the hidden safe had disappeared, probably spooked by his own courage.

The elevator ride to Dr. Lagos's office felt longer than usual, each floor bringing me closer to a decision I couldn't undo. The evidence was damning—corporate executives had known about the artifact's lethal radiation. They'd covered up early warning signs, pushed researchers to work longer hours with the technology, all to beat competitors to a marketable product.

Dr. Lagos wasn't alone when I arrived. A silver-haired man in an immaculately tailored suit stood at the window, hands clasped behind his back. CEO Richard Harmon, whose signature authorized the continuation of the project even after the first death.

"Detective," Lagos said, her smile not reaching her eyes. "I understand you've been quite thorough in your investigation."

"That's what you hired me for," I replied, remaining standing though she gestured to a chair.

"Indeed." She exchanged glances with Harmon. "And your findings?"

I had the evidence in my briefcase—or rather, some of it. I'd spent the early morning hours separating wheat from chaff, identifying which pieces would strengthen my position without revealing everything I knew. The most damning evidence—including Harmon's direct orders to continue testing despite safety concerns—I'd secreted elsewhere.

"Three researchers died from exposure to the lunar artifact," I said carefully. "The security logs show unusual access patterns before the artifact went missing. And there are... inconsistencies in the official reports."

"Concerning," Lagos nodded. "But not entirely unexpected in such a complex situation."

I placed selected documents on the table—enough to show I'd been thorough, not enough to show my full hand. "What concerns me most is the pattern. These weren't random accidents. Someone knew the risks and pushed forward anyway."

Harmon turned from the window, his face unreadable. "And who might that 'someone' be, detective?"

The air in the room felt charged. I had evidence that could implicate Harmon directly, could potentially destroy his career and the company's reputation. But revealing everything now might also destroy any chance of actual change. Sometimes in Westwick, you had to play the long game.

"Mid-level management," I said, watching relief flicker briefly in Harmon's eyes. "Project leads who cut corners to meet deadlines. Safety officers who falsified reports." I tapped the documents. "Their names are all here."

"I see," Harmon nodded, exchanging a glance with Lagos. "And is that the extent of your findings?"

I thought of the hidden evidence implicating him directly. "For now." 

"Well," Lagos said carefully, "This is certainly troubling. We'll need to take immediate action against these individuals."

"Absolutely," Harmon agreed, his confidence returning. "AeroCorp has zero tolerance for such behavior. We'll ensure those responsible face consequences."

They were offering me scapegoats. Mid-level employees would take the fall, while the executives who truly drove the dangerous research would remain untouched. It wasn't perfect justice, but it was something—and I still held the evidence to pursue the higher-ups if necessary.

"And the missing artifact?" I asked.

"Top priority," Harmon assured me. "We have teams searching for it now. When recovered, it will be handled with appropriate safety protocols."

"And the families of the deceased researchers?"

Lagos interjected, "They'll be compensated, of course. Generously."

This wasn't the clean victory I'd hoped for. The true villains would escape punishment, at least for now. But some justice would be served, safer protocols would be implemented, and families would receive compensation. And I'd maintain my position to potentially push for more later.

"I'll expect a full report on the actions taken," I said, gathering my selected documents. "Within the week."

"Of course," Harmon smiled, extending his hand. "AeroCorp appreciates your... discretion in this matter."

The unspoken deal hung in the air between us. I was agreeing to sacrifice complete justice for partial accountability. To let the biggest fish swim free while netting the smaller ones. Was it compromise or surrender?

The weight of the hidden evidence felt heavy in my pocket. A insurance policy for another day.

B) Change your mind and reveal everything now (Turn to Page 5BAA)
