[Page 4AAB: Necessary Compromise]

"Get down!" I shouted, tackling the district attorney to the pavement as bullets shattered the window behind us.

We hit the wet concrete of The Shallows hard, glass raining down around us. Three shots in rapid succession punched into the wall where we'd been standing seconds before. Professional work. Not some Drowntown thug with a twitchy trigger finger.

"You okay?" I asked, already pulling her toward the cover of a nearby canal boat.

Janet Okonkwo nodded, her eyes wide but focused. The DA was made of stronger stuff than most in this town. "They really don't want this evidence going public, do they?"

"Three corporate board members, two Shadow Agency directors, and the deputy mayor," I said, checking my revolver. "People kill for less in Westwick."

The assassin fired again from the rooftop across the canal, forcing us deeper into cover. Water lapped at our shoes—in The Shallows, you're never more than an inch from the flood.

"We need to get to the courthouse," Janet said, clutching her waterproof briefcase containing the damning files we'd assembled, the paper trail connecting lunar tech smuggling to the heights of Westwick power. "The grand jury is waiting."

I peered around the edge of our shelter, calculating angles and options. "There's a service tunnel entrance fifty yards down. Maintenance access that runs under the canal. It'll get us to City Hall without being spotted."

Another shot kicked up water near our position. We were running out of time.

"What's the play, detective?" Janet asked, trusting my experience in these streets. "We could call for backup, try to take this shooter down. Or make a run for that tunnel and get this evidence where it needs to go."

I had seconds to decide. Take down the assassin—likely get more evidence, another thread to pull in the conspiracy—but risk the files never making it to the grand jury. Or prioritize the evidence we already had, ensuring the case moved forward even if this particular triggerman escaped.

Justice or vengeance. The case or the killer.

In that moment, watching Janet's determined expression, I remembered the conversation we'd had in her office the previous day. The political realities of Westwick. How the powerful protected their own.

"Janet," I said quietly, "if we bring down everyone implicated in these files—all at once—what are our chances of success?"

She hesitated, her pragmatic side wrestling with her idealism. "Slim to none. The system protects itself. We'd face delays, dismissals, evidence suddenly ruled inadmissible..."

"But if we focused on the worst offenders? Cut deals with the smaller fish to testify against the bigger ones?"

Another bullet struck nearby. Decision time.

"Cover your head," I instructed, pulling off my trench coat. "When I say run, make straight for that maintenance door. Don't stop, don't look back."

I wadded up my coat, held it briefly above our cover. Two shots immediately tore through it. The assassin was still focused on us, hadn't moved position.

"Run!" I shouted, breaking from cover in the opposite direction from Janet, firing two shots toward the sniper's position. Not trying to hit him—just keeping his head down for precious seconds.

Janet sprinted for the maintenance tunnel, briefcase clutched to her chest. I continued my diversion, zigzagging between patches of cover, drawing the assassin's fire.

A bullet clipped my side, hot pain flaring across my ribs. But Janet had reached the maintenance door, was fumbling with the lock. Safe.

Twenty minutes later, we emerged a block from City Hall. My side was bandaged with Janet's scarf, the bleeding minimal. The files were intact.

"We need to be strategic," Janet said, her earlier idealism tempered by the reality of what had just happened. "Target the primary players, flip the secondary ones. Half a victory is better than a complete failure."

I nodded, thinking of the shooter who'd escaped. One thread left untied. But in this city, you learn to prioritize, to compromise. To settle for the justice you can get, not the justice you want.

"Let's bring down who we can," I agreed. "And live to fight another day."

You stand at the crossroads. Do you:
A) Stay the course with the compromise strategy (Turn to Page 5AAB)
B) Change your mind and push for complete justice (Turn to Page 5AAA)
