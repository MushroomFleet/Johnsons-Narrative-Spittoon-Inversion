[Page 4BBA: Heroic Rescue]

"Get down!" I shouted, pulling Vera behind a stack of rotting cargo crates as a hail of bullets splintered the wood around us.

The boathouse erupted in chaos. The corporate security team had arrived with overwhelming force—three boats converging on our position, floodlights cutting through the fog, the bark of automatic weapons echoing across Harbor Town's dark waters.

"They just want the artifact," Vera gasped, clutching the glowing device to her chest. "Maybe if we surrender it—"

"They want witnesses eliminated too," I said grimly, checking my revolver. Six rounds against what sounded like a small army. The math wasn't encouraging. "Those aren't warning shots."

The artifact pulsed in Vera's hands, its blue light intensifying with each throb. Something about the weapon fire or our fear seemed to be triggering a reaction in the lunar technology.

"It's becoming unstable," Vera whispered, panic edging into her voice. "The energy readings are spiking. If they hit it with gunfire..."

She didn't need to finish. Whatever the artifact contained—experimental energy, radiation, something not yet classified by earth science—it wouldn't react well to bullets.

Through a gap in the crates, I spotted a small maintenance door at the rear of the boathouse. Beyond it lay a series of narrow walkways that wound through Harbor Town's back canals. A maze of floating debris and abandoned structures that might give us a fighting chance.

"There's our exit," I nodded toward the door. "But we need a distraction."

The artifact pulsed again, brighter this time. An idea formed—desperate, but possibly our only option.

"That thing," I gestured to the artifact. "Can you modulate its energy output? Make it surge?"

Vera studied the device, her scientist's mind working through the problem despite our dire circumstances. "Theoretically, yes. It responds to electromagnetic fields. If I reverse the polarity of this component..." Her fingers worked deftly across the artifact's surface.

"Do it," I said. "Make it bright enough to blind them temporarily, but not enough to... you know."

"Explode," she finished flatly. "I'll try."

As Vera manipulated the device, I gathered what little courage remained and formulated a plan. The artifact would create our distraction. We'd use the chaos to reach the maintenance door. From there, I knew Harbor Town's hidden passages well enough to lose our pursuers. If we could reach Sofia's bakery, we'd find temporary sanctuary.

"Ready," Vera whispered, her face illuminated by the now-pulsing blue light. "When I complete this circuit, we'll have about three seconds of intense luminosity. It won't harm anyone, but it will overwhelm night vision and disorient them."

I nodded, gathering myself for what would likely be the most dangerous sprint of my life. "On three. One. Two..."

"Three!" Vera pressed something on the artifact.

The world went blue-white, the artifact's light exploding outward like a miniature sun. Shouts of surprise and pain erupted from our pursuers. I grabbed Vera's arm and ran for the maintenance door, half-dragging her across the wooden planks.

We burst through onto the narrow walkways of Harbor Town's forgotten canals, the ambient glow from the artifact now dimmed to its previous state. Behind us, confusion reigned as security forces stumbled blindly in the boathouse.

"This way," I pulled Vera down a side passage where the walkway had partially collapsed into the water. We'd have to wade, but it would throw off pursuit.

Vera hesitated. "The artifact can't get wet. The manual explicitly warned—"

A bullet splintered the wood near my head. Our pursuers had recovered faster than expected.

"Give me the artifact," I said, making a split-second decision. "I'll keep it dry. You focus on following me exactly."

Vera handed over the device, its weight surprising in my palm. The responsibility it represented felt even heavier.

We splashed into the fetid canal water, keeping to shadows as we navigated the labyrinthine passages of Harbor Town. Behind us, searchlights swept the main channels, but the narrow service ways I'd chosen were known only to locals and those, like me, who had mapped Westwick's forgotten corners out of professional necessity.

Twenty minutes of evasion brought us to a rusted fire escape hidden behind a defunct cannery. Five flights up, we found temporary shelter in an abandoned apartment, its windows offering a view of the ongoing search below.

"They're not giving up," Vera observed, watching boats patrol the canals. "That artifact must be incredibly valuable."

"Valuable enough to kill for," I agreed, setting the still-glowing device on a dusty table. "The question is: what do we do now?"

The artifact pulsed gently, as if offering its own opinion on our dilemma. We could try to reach the authorities, but who could we trust? The Shadow Agency had its own agenda. The police were notoriously susceptible to corporate influence. And AeroCorp itself had just tried to gun us down in Harbor Town.

"I need to get to my contact at the Tribune," I said, forming a plan. "A journalist named Carson. He's been investigating AeroCorp for months. With your testimony and this artifact as evidence, we could expose everything."

"And then what?" Vera asked quietly. "AeroCorp isn't the only corporation experimenting with lunar technology. Exposing them won't end the danger."

She was right. This was bigger than one company, one artifact. The whole system needed reform—oversight, regulation, accountability for technologies we barely understood.

"One step at a time," I said. "First, we need to get you somewhere safe. Then we can figure out what to do with this thing."

Vera looked at me with unexpected determination. "No. First we need to ensure this artifact can never hurt anyone else. I know how to neutralize it—permanently. But I'd need equipment, a lab..."

I thought of Dr. Zain Okonkwo, whose independent research facility in The Stilts might have what we needed. It would be risky to move again with corporate security hunting us, but perhaps less risky than keeping an unstable lunar artifact active.

The choice crystallized. We could prioritize Vera's safety, getting her to protective custody where her testimony could drive systematic change. Or we could focus on securing the artifact first, eliminating the immediate danger it posed but risking Vera's capture or worse.

You stand at the crossroads. Do you:
A) Prioritize saving Vera, the whistleblower (Turn to Page 5BBA)
B) Focus on neutralizing the dangerous artifact (Turn to Page 5BBB)
