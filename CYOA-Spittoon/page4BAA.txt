[Page 4BAA: Corporate Whistleblower]

"Dr. Lagos needs to see you immediately," the security guard said, his expression unreadable behind reflective glasses. "Fifty-third floor."

I'd spent the morning cataloging evidence in Dr. Chen's secret records—names, dates, experimental logs that documented not just the death of three researchers, but the deliberate coverup orchestrated by AeroCorp's executive team. The assistant who'd shown me the hidden safe had disappeared, probably spooked by his own courage.

The elevator ride to Dr. Lagos's office felt longer than usual, each floor bringing me closer to a decision I couldn't undo. The evidence was damning—corporate executives had known about the artifact's lethal radiation. They'd covered up early warning signs, pushed researchers to work longer hours with the technology, all to beat competitors to a marketable product.

Dr. Lagos wasn't alone when I arrived. A silver-haired man in an immaculately tailored suit stood at the window, hands clasped behind his back. CEO Richard Harmon, whose signature authorized the continuation of the project even after the first death.

"Detective," Lagos said, her smile not reaching her eyes. "I understand you've been quite thorough in your investigation."

"That's what you hired me for," I replied, remaining standing though she gestured to a chair.

"Indeed." She exchanged glances with Harmon. "And your findings?"

I had the evidence in my briefcase—the original files, not copies. I could hand them over, complete my contract, collect my substantial fee. AeroCorp would bury everything deeper than The Depths themselves, and three dead scientists would never receive justice.

Or I could do what I knew was right.

"Three researchers died from prolonged exposure to an unstable lunar artifact," I said evenly. "An artifact your company continued experimenting with despite knowing the risks. An artifact that's still missing, potentially endangering more lives."

"A regrettable situation," Harmon spoke for the first time, his voice smooth as polished marble. "Accidents in cutting-edge research are sometimes unavoidable."

"They weren't accidents." I met his gaze steadily. "They were negligent homicide. And I have the documents to prove it."

The temperature in the room seemed to drop. Lagos's expression hardened while Harmon turned from the window to face me fully.

"Those are serious allegations, detective," the CEO said. "Allegations that could damage this company, cost jobs, destroy innovation that could benefit millions."

"I'm not interested in destroying anything," I replied. "I'm interested in justice for three dead scientists. And ensuring no one else dies because of corporate greed."

"What exactly do you want?" Lagos asked, her voice tight.

"Full disclosure. Compensation for the families. A complete safety review of all lunar technology research. And the recovery of the missing artifact before it kills anyone else."

Harmon laughed, though there was no humor in it. "Do you have any idea what that would cost? What it would do to our stock price? The board would never approve."

"Then I take everything I've found to the district attorney." I tapped my briefcase. "And to every newspaper in Westwick."

The threat hung in the air between us. Lagos looked to Harmon, who was calculating odds and outcomes behind his impassive expression.

"There are other options," he said finally, moving to his desk and removing an envelope. "More... beneficial arrangements for everyone involved."

I knew what was in the envelope without seeing it. Money. Enough to fix my office, my apartment, set me up somewhere dry in The Heights if I wanted. All for my silence.

"Not interested."

"Everyone has a price, detective," Lagos said quietly.

"Not for this." I turned toward the door. "I'm going to the DA's office now. What happens next is up to you."

"You won't make it out of the building," Harmon's voice had lost its polished veneer. "Corporate security is quite thorough."

I paused at the door. "I made copies. If I don't contact certain people by noon, those copies go public. Whistleblower insurance."

It was a bluff—I hadn't had time to make copies. But it was the kind of precaution they would expect from someone in my position. The kind of precaution they themselves would take.

"Wait," Lagos called as I reached for the door handle. "Perhaps... perhaps we can find a compromise."

I turned back, watching their faces. This was the moment where everything could go right—or terribly wrong.

A) Stand firm on full corporate accountability (Turn to Page 5BAA)
B) Accept a reasonable compromise to ensure some justice (Turn to Page 5BAB)
