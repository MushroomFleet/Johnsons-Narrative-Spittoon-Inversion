The Shadow Agency representative adjusted her immaculate suit as she surveyed the lunar artifact on the table between us. The soft blue glow of the device reflected in her glasses, hiding her eyes. We sat in a sterile meeting room in their unmarked office building in The Heights, far above the waterline and the problems of ordinary citizens.

"Your work has been... thorough, Mr. Morales-Singh," she said, her voice as precisely modulated as everything else about her. "The Agency appreciates your discretion in this matter."

I kept my face neutral, though my side throbbed where the corporate enforcer's bullet had grazed me during the confrontation in The Shallows. "Just doing my job."

She slid a sleek folder across the table. "Your full fee, plus the agreed-upon hazard bonus. The Agency considers this case closed."

I didn't touch the folder. "And the people behind this? The names I provided?"

"Will be handled through appropriate channels." Her smile didn't reach her eyes. "Some of these individuals have significant connections. The process must be... delicate."

"Delicate." I let the word hang in the air between us. "Like how the dame nearly got her throat cut in Drowntown while your agents were being 'delicate'?"

The representative's expression didn't change. "A regrettable development. But Ms. Chen is safe now, and the artifact recovered. The technology it contains will not fall into unauthorized hands."

I thought about the partial copy of the artifact's data I'd made before contacting the Agency. About the names stored there, the connections to corporate boards and government officials. About how easily evidence could disappear in this town, especially when it implicated the powerful.

"The full report is in the file," I said, gesturing to the documents I'd provided. Most of them, anyway. "Everything I found on the lunar tech smuggling operation."

She nodded, seemingly satisfied. "Then our business is concluded. The Agency will take possession of the artifact now."

I had a choice to make. I could hand over everythingâ€”the artifact, all my evidence, every scrap of intelligence I'd gathered about who was really behind the smuggling ring. Trust the system to work, the Agency to do its job despite its connections to the very people I'd been investigating.

Or I could keep something back. A small piece of lunar tech I'd separated from the main artifact. Insurance against the case being buried, against the truth being drowned like so much of old Westwick.

"One moment," I said, reaching for the artifact on the table. "Let me disconnect this last component before transport. Standard procedure for safety."

The Shadow Agent watched as I worked, my hands moving with practiced precision as I detached a small component from the larger device. A redundant part, I told her. Nothing significant.

She didn't notice when I pocketed one tiny piece as I reassembled the rest. Or if she did, she chose not to mention it.

"The Agency thanks you for your service," she said as she took possession of the artifact, securing it in a specialized containment case. "Your country thanks you."

I nodded, finally taking the folder with my payment. "Just make sure justice is served. That's all I ask."

Her smile was thin. "Justice is always served, Mr. Morales-Singh. In its proper measure and time."

As I left the Agency building and stepped out into the mist-shrouded evening, I felt the weight of the lunar tech component in my pocket. Not enough to cause harm, but enough to keep the powerful honest. Evidence that couldn't be erased from the record.

Insurance against a system I wasn't sure I could trust.

You stand at the crossroads. Do you:
A) Trust the Shadow Agency with the complete evidence (Turn to Page 5ABA)
B) Keep the piece of lunar tech as insurance (Turn to Page 5ABB)
