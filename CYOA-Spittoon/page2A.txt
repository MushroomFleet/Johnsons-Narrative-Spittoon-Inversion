[Page 2A: The Shallows Lead]

The address from my informant led to a ramshackle pub in The Shallows called The Sinking Anchor. Two feet of perpetual floodwater lapped at the stilts supporting the building, forcing patrons to use a series of improvised walkways to reach the entrance. The fog was rolling in thick tonight, diffusing the neon signs into hazy halos of color.

I adjusted my fedora against the misty rain and made my way across the creaking planks. In The Shallows, you learned to test each step before committing your weight. One rotten board could send you into the fetid waters below—and in this district, a soaking was the least of your worries.

Inside, the pub was a study in controlled decay. Watermarks stained the walls up to three feet, evidence of the district's gradual submersion. The clientele matched the surroundings—dockworkers, canal runners, and the occasional corporate spy slumming for information.

Vera Chen sat in a corner booth, exactly as my informant had described: early thirties, Chinese-American, with the unmistakable intensity of a scientist who'd seen something she couldn't unsee. She nursed a drink that looked untouched, her eyes constantly scanning the room.

I slid into the seat across from her, keeping my hands visible. "Ms. Chen? Elijah Morales-Singh. I understand you're looking for someone with my particular skillset."

She studied me with analytical precision. "How do I know I can trust you?"

"You don't," I replied honestly. "But three people are dead, and you're next on the list unless you get help."

Her eyes widened slightly. "You know about the deaths?"

"I know AeroCorp is calling them accidents. I know all three victims worked on the same lunar technology project. And I know corporate security has been asking about you in Drowntown." I leaned forward. "What I don't know is what was so important about that project that people are dying for it."

Vera glanced nervously around the bar before reaching into her coat pocket. She placed a small photograph on the table—a strange cylindrical device glowing with an unearthly blue light.

"We called it the Lumina Artifact," she whispered. "Recovered from the dark side of the moon in '49. AeroCorp acquired it from the Shadow Agency last year for 'research purposes.'" Her finger tapped the image. "It generates energy unlike anything we've seen before. Clean. Powerful. Potentially unlimited."

"Enough to make someone rich," I observed.

"Or to change the balance of power in Westwick." Vera's voice hardened. "But there are side effects we don't understand. Radiation signatures that don't match known patterns. The researchers who died—they were exposed to the artifact for the longest periods."

"And now it's missing," I concluded.

She nodded. "Stolen three days ago. The same day Dr. Okonkwo died." Her hands trembled slightly. "I've been hiding ever since. But I have a lead—one of our security personnel was acting strangely before the theft. Accessing restricted areas, making unusual calls from the company phone system."

"You have a name?"

"Rodriguez. Marcus Rodriguez. Ex-military. He has a girlfriend in The Shallows. A dancer at the Blue Moon."

I processed this information, weighing our options. We could track down Rodriguez immediately, potentially catching him off-guard but risking a confrontation we weren't prepared for. Or we could gather more evidence first, building a stronger case but giving our quarry more time to cover his tracks or escape entirely.

"There's something else," Vera added, lowering her voice further. "I think someone at AeroCorp helped with the theft. Someone high up. The security protocols that were bypassed—they required executive clearance."

The implications were clear. If corporate executives were involved, this went beyond simple theft. The whole power structure of Westwick could be implicated.

"We need to decide quickly," I said, noting two men at the bar who'd been watching our table with too much interest. "Those corporate types by the bar didn't follow you here by accident."

Vera's expression tightened with resolve. "What's our play, detective?"

You stand at the crossroads. Do you:
A) Confront Rodriguez at the Blue Moon immediately (Turn to Page 3AA)
B) Gather more evidence about the corporate connection first (Turn to Page 3AB)
