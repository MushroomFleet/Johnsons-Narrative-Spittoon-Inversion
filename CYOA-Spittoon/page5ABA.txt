[Page 5ABA: Neutral Ending - By the Book]

... and in the end, I followed protocol, for all the good it did.

I stood on the elevated walkway of The Stilts, watching the fog roll in from the harbor. The moon hung low and heavy in the sky, its cratered surface a reminder of how much had changed since '48. My reflection wavered in the floodwaters below, distorted by the neon lights from the jazz club across the canal.

The case was closed—officially and completely. The lunar artifact had been returned to the Shadow Agency's vault by morning, processed through proper channels, documented and filed away. The dame was in protective custody somewhere in The Heights, her testimony recorded and archived according to regulation. Everything by the book, every form signed in triplicate. For whatever that was worth.

I lit a cigarette, watching the embers glow in the perpetual mist. My fedora was still damp from the chase through The Shallows, water damage being an occupational hazard in this town. The wound in my side had stopped bleeding, but the doctor said I'd feel it when the winter came. A reminder of procedure followed and justice delayed.

In my pocket, the official commendation letter from the Shadow Agency felt stiff and hollow. Congratulations on a case well handled, they said. Grateful for my adherence to protocol. No mention of the names still walking free, the higher-ups whose signatures appeared on damning documents. No acknowledgment of the questions left hanging like the perpetual fog.

I'd solved the puzzle, followed the breadcrumbs from the flooded basements of the old financial district to the pristine towers of corporate power. I'd uncovered names, connections, a conspiracy that reached higher than the church spires that dominated our skyline. And I'd dutifully reported it all up the chain of command, watched as the information disappeared into committees and subcommittees, redacted reports and closed-door hearings.

The amphibious cab pulled up to the walkway, water sloshing against its modified chassis. The driver didn't recognize me—I was just another face in Westwick now, not the detective who'd rocked any boats. "Where to, mister?" he called out.

Tomorrow, there would be no headlines. No arrests of prominent figures. No real changes to how things operated. Perhaps some low-level operatives would be quietly reassigned. Maybe some policies would be reviewed, in time. The bureaucratic wheels would turn slowly, grinding the sharp edges off the truth until it could be safely filed away.

That's how systems protect themselves in this half-drowned city. Not with dramatic confrontations, but with paperwork and process, reports and recommendations.

I tossed my cigarette into the dark water and watched it extinguish with a soft hiss. For a moment, I questioned the choice I'd made to trust the system. To believe that working within the rules would lead to justice.

"Finnegan's Bar," I told the cabbie, settling into the back seat.

In Westwick, you learn that following the letter of the law doesn't always lead to justice. Sometimes it just leads to more paperwork.

Some mysteries get solved but never resolved. Some truths get documented but never acted upon.

And some detectives learn that swimming in the right lanes doesn't mean you're making progress—sometimes you're just treading water in a larger pool.

THE END
