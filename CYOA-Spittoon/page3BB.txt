[Page 3BB: Harbor Town Revelation]

The rain came down in sheets as I navigated the warped boardwalks of Harbor Town, my shoes squelching with every step. The district smelled of brine, diesel, and desperation—the pungent cocktail of Westwick's maritime underbelly.

Sofia Tejada-Kim's bakery was wedged between a ship chandler's and a dubious pawn shop, its windows glowing with warm light that belied its owner's complicated past. I'd met Sofia during my military days, though neither of us spoke about how or where. What mattered was that she saw everything that moved through Harbor Town and owed me a favor I'd never collected. Until tonight.

The bell jingled as I entered, shaking water from my fedora. Sofia looked up from behind the counter, her silver-streaked hair pulled into its usual immaculate bun. She dismissed her last customer with practiced efficiency before flipping the "Closed" sign.

"Elijah Morales-Singh," she said, her accent a melodic blend of Korean and Dominican inflections. "You look like a drowned cat." She produced a towel from beneath the counter, tossing it my way. "And you smell like The Depths."

"Occupational hazard," I replied, drying my face. "I need information, Sofia."

She gestured to the back room. "People who visit me this late always do."

The kitchen doubled as her office, immaculate steel counters lined with perfect rows of baking equipment. She poured us both tea from an ornate pot, the aromatic steam filling the space.

"You're investigating the AeroCorp deaths," she stated, not a question.

I raised an eyebrow. "Word travels fast."

"Faster than the tide." She sipped her tea. "Three scientists dead, lunar technology missing. Corporate security scrambling. Shadow Agency lurking in the corners." Her eyes met mine over the rim of her cup. "Dangerous waters, even for an old fish like you."

"I need to know where the missing artifact is."

Sofia's expression didn't change, but she set her cup down with deliberate precision. "What makes you think I would know?"

"Because nothing moves through Harbor Town without crossing your radar. Because you still maintain connections with certain intelligence communities. And because two nights ago, a terrified woman scientist came to this district seeking help."

That earned me a slight nod of appreciation. "You've been busy."

"The woman, Sofia. Where is she?"

Sofia studied me for a long moment, weighing risks and loyalties. Finally, she rose and went to a bread oven, reaching deep inside to remove a concealed panel. From a hidden compartment, she extracted a worn leather pouch.

"Maya Chen came here three nights ago," she said, returning to the table. "Scared but determined. She'd discovered something about the lunar artifact she was researching. Something AeroCorp was willing to kill for."

She placed the pouch before me. Inside was a small data drive and a hand-drawn map.

"The artifact was split," Sofia continued. "What AeroCorp has is just a fragment. The rest is hidden where only Maya knew to look." Her voice dropped. "She said its energy signature was unstable. That combining the pieces incorrectly could be catastrophic."

"Where is she now?"

Sofia's eyes flickered with rare emotion. "Safe. For the moment. But AeroCorp's hunters are persistent, and the Shadow Agency has deployed assets throughout the district." She tapped the map. "This leads to the complete artifact. Maya wanted it found by someone who wouldn't misuse it." Her gaze was pointed. "Someone she could trust."

I studied the map—it marked a location in the abandoned shipyards at the edge of The Depths, accessible only by boat during high tide.

The bell in the front shop jingled. Sofia tensed, reaching for something beneath the counter.

"Back door," she whispered, passing me a small key. "Old boathouse, third dock past the rusted crane. Password is 'moonfall.' They're expecting you."

"They?"

"You're not the only one Maya reached out to. There's a woman waiting there—the artifact's original finder. She'll help you retrieve it." Sofia's expression hardened as footsteps approached the kitchen. "You need to choose quickly, detective. The artifact or the woman. You won't be able to save both."

I slipped out the back door into the rain-soaked alley just as I heard voices in the kitchen—the clipped tones of corporate security or government agents. Sofia would handle them; she'd navigated worse interrogations.

Twenty minutes later, I stood on the creaking planks of the third dock, rain plastering my coat to my shoulders. The boathouse loomed ahead, a dark silhouette against the misty harbor.

Inside, I found a woman waiting beside a small motorboat, her face illuminated by the soft blue glow of a device in her hands. The missing lunar artifact. 

"Detective Morales-Singh," she said, her voice steady despite the fear evident in her eyes. "Maya said you might come. I'm Vera."

As she spoke, the artifact pulsed, its light intensifying. Through the boathouse's grimy windows, I could see approaching lights on the water. Hunters, closing in from multiple directions.

"We need to move," Vera urged, clutching the artifact protectively. "There's not much time."

I had a choice to make. We could try to escape with the artifact, risking both our lives but keeping the technology from falling into dangerous hands. Or I could focus on getting Vera to safety, ensuring Maya's colleague survived to testify even if the artifact was lost in the process.

The approaching boats drew nearer, their searchlights sweeping across the harbor waters.

You stand at the crossroads. Do you:
A) Prioritize saving Vera, the whistleblower (Turn to Page 4BBA)
B) Secure the artifact at all costs (Turn to Page 4BBB)
