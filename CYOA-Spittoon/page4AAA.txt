[Page 4AAA: Justice Prevails]

"Get down!" I shouted, tackling the district attorney to the pavement as bullets shattered the window behind us.

We hit the wet concrete of The Shallows hard, glass raining down around us. Three shots in rapid succession punched into the wall where we'd been standing seconds before. Professional work. Not some Drowntown thug with a twitchy trigger finger.

"You okay?" I asked, already pulling her toward the cover of a nearby canal boat.

Janet Okonkwo nodded, her eyes wide but focused. The DA was made of stronger stuff than most in this town. "They really don't want this evidence going public, do they?"

"Three corporate board members, two Shadow Agency directors, and the deputy mayor," I said, checking my revolver. "People kill for less in Westwick."

The assassin fired again from the rooftop across the canal, forcing us deeper into cover. Water lapped at our shoes—in The Shallows, you're never more than an inch from the flood. 

"We need to get to the courthouse," Janet said, clutching her waterproof briefcase containing the damning files we'd assembled, the paper trail connecting lunar tech smuggling to the heights of Westwick power. "The grand jury is waiting."

I peered around the edge of our shelter, calculating angles and options. "There's a service tunnel entrance fifty yards down. Maintenance access that runs under the canal. It'll get us to City Hall without being spotted."

Another shot kicked up water near our position. We were running out of time.

"What's the play, detective?" Janet asked, trusting my experience in these streets. "We could call for backup, try to take this shooter down. Or make a run for that tunnel and get this evidence where it needs to go."

I had seconds to decide. Take down the assassin—likely get more evidence, another thread to pull in the conspiracy—but risk the files never making it to the grand jury. Or prioritize the evidence we already had, ensuring the case moved forward even if this particular triggerman escaped.

Justice or vengeance. The case or the killer.

In that moment, watching the DA's determined expression, I thought about why I became a detective in the first place. Not to hunt down every last criminal, but to protect the system itself. To make the machinery of justice work in a city where it so often failed.

"Cover your head with your jacket," I instructed, pulling off my trench coat. "When I say run, make straight for that maintenance door. Don't stop, don't look back."

I wadded up my coat, held it briefly above our cover. Two shots immediately tore through it. The assassin was still focused on us, hadn't moved position.

"Run!" I shouted, breaking from cover in the opposite direction from Janet, firing two shots toward the sniper's position. Not trying to hit him—just keeping his head down for precious seconds.

Janet sprinted for the maintenance tunnel, briefcase clutched to her chest. I continued my diversion, zigzagging between patches of cover, drawing the assassin's fire.

A bullet clipped my side, hot pain flaring across my ribs. But Janet had reached the maintenance door, was fumbling with the lock. Safe.

Twenty minutes later, we emerged a block from City Hall. My side was bandaged with Janet's scarf, the bleeding minimal. The files were intact.

"We still have ten minutes before the grand jury convenes," Janet said, her earlier fear now replaced with fierce determination. "With this evidence, we can bring the whole operation down. No deals, no compromises."

I nodded, thinking of the shooter who'd escaped. One thread left untied. But sometimes you have to choose the greater victory.

"Let justice be done," I said, "though the heavens fall."

You stand at the crossroads. Do you:
A) Pursue complete justice without compromise (Turn to Page 5AAA)
B) Accept practical justice with strategic compromises (Turn to Page 5AAB)
