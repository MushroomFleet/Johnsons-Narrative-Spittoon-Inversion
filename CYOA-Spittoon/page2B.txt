[Page 2B: Corporate Trail]

The lobby of AeroCorp Tower gleamed with the sterile opulence that only truly successful corporations could achieve. Sixty stories of glass and steel rising from The Heights, so far above the waterline that the perpetual fog of Westwick was just a distant blanket below. I felt out of place in my well-worn trench coat and water-damaged shoes, but I'd learned long ago that confidence was the best disguise in places like this.

"Mr. Morales-Singh?" The receptionist's smile was professionally calibrated—warm enough to be welcoming, cool enough to maintain distance. "Dr. Lagos will see you now. Fifty-third floor."

The elevator rose silently, each floor putting more distance between me and the half-drowned streets I usually worked. My reflection in the polished doors showed a man caught between worlds—too rough for the corporate heights, too straight-laced for the criminal depths.

I'd made the decision to investigate directly through official channels rather than chasing informants through The Shallows. Three deaths among AeroCorp's research staff in two weeks couldn't be ignored, no matter how the company had tried to sweep them under the rug. Sometimes the direct approach yielded results that backroom deals couldn't.

Dr. Amara Lagos met me in a conference room with views spanning half the city. She was everything her reputation suggested—brilliant, composed, with the subtle hardness of someone who'd climbed the corporate ladder by stepping on fingers when necessary.

"Detective," she said, gesturing to a chair. "I must say, your request for a meeting was... unconventional. We typically liaise with the police department through official channels."

"I'm not with the department anymore, Dr. Lagos. Private investigator now." I set my recorder on the table between us. "Mind if I document our conversation?"

She hesitated, then nodded. Professional courtesy or confidence in her ability to control the narrative—hard to tell with corporate types.

"I'm investigating the deaths of three AeroCorp researchers," I said, watching her face for reactions. "Dr. Zain Okonkwo, Dr. Marcus Chen, and Dr. Eliza Rodriguez. All working on the same project. All dead within two weeks."

"A tragic series of coincidences," Lagos replied smoothly. "Dr. Okonkwo suffered heart failure, Dr. Chen was involved in a boating accident in The Shallows, and Dr. Rodriguez's death was ruled a suicide. Our entire research division is devastated."

"And the lunar artifact they were studying? Also a coincidence that it went missing the day Dr. Okonkwo died?"

That earned me a micro-expression of surprise before her corporate mask reasserted itself. "I'm not authorized to discuss proprietary research matters with outside parties."

"Three dead scientists isn't a research matter, doctor. It's potentially a murder investigation."

Lagos leaned back, reassessing me. "What exactly do you want, detective?"

"Access to the research facility. Interviews with the remaining team members. Security footage from the days surrounding each death." I kept my tone reasonable, professional. "I'm not looking to compromise corporate secrets. I just want to know if someone is killing scientists in this city."

She seemed to calculate risk factors, possibilities. "And if I refuse?"

"Then I start asking these questions more publicly. To the police. To the press. To the families of the deceased." I offered a thin smile. "Corporate share prices tend to react poorly to that kind of attention."

Lagos pressed a button on the conference table. "Ms. Reeves, please bring me the visitor clearance forms and contact Mr. Harrington in security." She turned back to me. "I can arrange limited access. Supervised, of course. And subject to our confidentiality agreements."

"Of course."

"I should warn you, detective," she added as she stood, "that you may be stepping into matters beyond your understanding. Lunar technology research involves... complexities... that even our scientists struggle to comprehend."

"I don't need to understand the science, doctor. Just the motives."

As Lagos left to arrange my clearance, I moved to the window. From this height, Westwick looked almost peaceful, the divisions between flooded and dry districts less obvious. But I knew the truth—the city was stratified by more than just water. Power, money, influence—they all flowed upward, pooling in places like this tower while those below struggled to keep their heads above the rising tide.

I had to choose. I could use this corporate access as intended, working within their system to find answers while navigating their restrictions and surveillance. Or I could use it as cover, maintaining the appearance of cooperation while conducting my own covert investigation, looking for evidence they wouldn't want me to find.

Playing by their rules might get me further into their confidence, opening doors that would otherwise remain closed. But those same rules would constrain me, potentially hiding the full truth behind corporate policy and legal barriers.

Going my own way carried risks—if caught, I'd lose access entirely. But it might reveal what they were desperate to conceal.

The choice would shape everything that followed.

You stand at the crossroads. Do you:
A) Accept corporate help and work within their system (Turn to Page 3BA)
B) Use your access as cover for your own investigation (Turn to Page 3BB)
