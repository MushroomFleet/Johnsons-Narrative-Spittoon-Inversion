[Page 4BBB: Artifact Security]

"The artifact comes first," I said firmly, watching Vera's face fall as the reality of my decision registered. "Too many have died already."

The boathouse erupted in chaos. The corporate security team had arrived with overwhelming force—three boats converging on our position, floodlights cutting through the fog, the bark of automatic weapons echoing across Harbor Town's dark waters.

"They just want the artifact," Vera gasped, clutching the glowing device to her chest. "Maybe if we surrender it—"

"They want witnesses eliminated too," I said grimly, checking my revolver. Six rounds against what sounded like a small army. The math wasn't encouraging. "Those aren't warning shots."

The artifact pulsed in Vera's hands, its blue light intensifying with each throb. Something about the weapon fire or our fear seemed to be triggering a reaction in the lunar technology.

"It's becoming unstable," Vera whispered, panic edging into her voice. "The energy readings are spiking. If they hit it with gunfire..."

She didn't need to finish. Whatever the artifact contained—experimental energy, radiation, something not yet classified by earth science—it wouldn't react well to bullets.

Through a gap in the crates, I spotted a small maintenance door at the rear of the boathouse. Beyond it lay a series of narrow walkways that wound through Harbor Town's back canals. A maze of floating debris and abandoned structures that might give us a fighting chance.

"There's our exit," I nodded toward the door. "But we need a distraction."

The artifact pulsed again, brighter this time. An idea formed—desperate, but possibly our only option.

"That thing," I gestured to the artifact. "Can you modulate its energy output? Make it surge?"

Vera studied the device, her scientist's mind working through the problem despite our dire circumstances. "Theoretically, yes. It responds to electromagnetic fields. If I reverse the polarity of this component..." Her fingers worked deftly across the artifact's surface.

"Do it," I said. "Make it bright enough to blind them temporarily, but not enough to... you know."

"Explode," she finished flatly. "I'll try."

As Vera manipulated the device, I formulated our escape. The artifact would create our distraction. We'd use the chaos to reach the maintenance door. From there, I knew Harbor Town's hidden passages well enough to lose our pursuers.

"Ready," Vera whispered, her face illuminated by the now-pulsing blue light. "When I complete this circuit, we'll have about three seconds of intense luminosity. It won't harm anyone, but it will overwhelm night vision and disorient them."

I nodded, gathering myself for what would likely be the most dangerous sprint of my life. "On three. One. Two..."

"Three!" Vera pressed something on the artifact.

The world went blue-white, the artifact's light exploding outward like a miniature sun. Shouts of surprise and pain erupted from our pursuers. I grabbed Vera's arm and ran for the maintenance door, half-dragging her across the wooden planks.

We burst through onto the narrow walkways of Harbor Town's forgotten canals, the ambient glow from the artifact now dimmed to its previous state. Behind us, confusion reigned as security forces stumbled blindly in the boathouse.

"This way," I pulled Vera down a side passage where the walkway had partially collapsed into the water. We'd have to wade, but it would throw off pursuit.

Vera hesitated. "The artifact can't get wet. The manual explicitly warned—"

A bullet splintered the wood near my head. Our pursuers had recovered faster than expected.

"Give me the artifact," I said, making a split-second decision. "I'll keep it dry. You focus on following me exactly."

Vera handed over the device, its weight surprising in my palm. The responsibility it represented felt even heavier.

We splashed into the fetid canal water, keeping to shadows as we navigated the labyrinthine passages of Harbor Town. Behind us, searchlights swept the main channels, but the narrow service ways I'd chosen were known only to locals and those, like me, who had mapped Westwick's forgotten corners out of professional necessity.

As we reached a junction where the canal split in three directions, I heard Vera cry out behind me. Turning, I saw her slip on the algae-slick walkway, tumbling toward the dark water. In the same moment, a searchlight swept across the canal just yards away.

I had seconds to decide. Save Vera, risking exposure to the searchlight and potentially damaging the artifact in the process. Or secure the artifact, using the few precious seconds to duck into a hidden passage I knew lay just ahead, leaving Vera to fend for herself.

The artifact pulsed in my hand, its eerie blue light reflecting on the canal water. Three researchers had already died because of this technology. How many more might follow if it fell into the wrong hands again?

"I'm sorry," I whispered, turning away from Vera's struggling form. The artifact had to be secured.

I ducked into the hidden passage as shouting erupted behind me. The sounds of Vera's capture—or worse—echoed through the canal ways, but I forced myself forward. The weight of the artifact seemed to grow with each step, a physical manifestation of the choice I'd just made.

Hours later, I sat in a safe house in The Stilts, the artifact secured in a lead-lined box I'd acquired from an old military contact. The Tribune journalist I trusted had been called. The evidence would be published by morning.

Justice would be served. The conspiracy exposed. Future deaths prevented.

But at what cost?

You stand at the crossroads. Do you:
A) Keep the artifact as evidence and leverage (Turn to Page 5BBB)
B) Return for Vera, risking everything (Turn to Page 5BBA)
