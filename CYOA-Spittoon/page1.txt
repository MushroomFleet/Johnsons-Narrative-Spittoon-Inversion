[Page 1: Initial Investigation]

The call came in just after midnight, when the perpetual rain of Westwick was at its heaviest. I was nursing my third whiskey in my office above Finnegan's Bar, reviewing case notes that were going nowhere.

"Morales-Singh Investigations," I answered, watching water trace patterns down the window. The city lights refracted through the droplets, prisms of neon breaking apart and reforming.

"Detective," the voice was male, cultured, with the clipped precision of The Heights. "I understand you're discreet."

"Depends on what needs discretion," I replied, reaching for a notepad. Work had been scarce lately. The flooded districts of Westwick generated plenty of crime but little in the way of paying clients.

"I represent certain interests at AeroCorp." A name that carried weight—one of the aerospace firms that had boomed since the '48 moon landing. "We have a... situation requiring investigation. Outside official channels."

"I'm listening."

"Three researchers. Dead within two weeks. The company is calling them accidents, but..." A pause, the sound of paper rustling. "The circumstances are troubling. And now sensitive technology has gone missing."

I straightened in my chair. "What kind of technology?"

"Lunar-derived. Experimental. That's all I can say over the phone." The man's voice dropped lower. "Five thousand now, five upon completion. Cash."

That was serious money in a city where most of my clients paid in favors or bootleg liquor. "Why me?"

"Your military engineering background. Your police record before you went private. Most importantly, your reputation for keeping confidences." Another pause. "We need someone who understands both technology and people, detective. Someone who can navigate corporate politics and waterfront dive bars with equal facility."

He left an address—a drop point in The Shallows where I'd find an envelope with preliminary information and the first payment. No names, no direct contact.

After he hung up, I stared at the address I'd written down. Something felt off. The money was too good, the client too conveniently anonymous. In my experience, when corporate types couldn't handle problems through official channels, those problems were usually lethal.

I had options. I could follow the corporate money, pick up the envelope, play their game. The cash would keep my office open for months, maybe even let me fix the leak in my apartment ceiling.

Or I could work from another angle. An old informant had mentioned AeroCorp recently—something about a scientist gone into hiding. Said she was looking for help, willing to pay what little she had for protection. A riskier lead, but potentially more honest than whatever sanitized version my corporate caller would provide.

The rain intensified, drumming against the window like impatient fingers. I finished my whiskey and considered the city spread out below—The Heights rising above the permanent mist, The Shallows partially submerged but still habitable, The Depths claimed entirely by the waters that had risen after the failed tidal engineering project of '46.

In Westwick, truth was as stratified as the city itself. Where you looked determined what you found.

You stand at the crossroads. Do you:
A) Trust the informant and follow the lead in The Shallows (Turn to Page 2A)
B) Investigate directly through AeroCorp's corporate channels (Turn to Page 2B)
