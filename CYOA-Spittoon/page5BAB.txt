[Page 5BAB: Neutral Ending - Compromise]

... and in the end, I chose selective silence, a dubious middle path.

I stood on the elevated walkway of The Stilts, watching the fog roll in from the harbor. The moon hung low and heavy in the sky, its cratered surface a reminder of how much had changed since '48. My reflection wavered in the floodwaters below, distorted by the neon lights from the jazz club across the canal.

The case was closed—partially, selectively. The lunar artifact would be returned to the Shadow Agency's vault by morning. The dame was safe in The Heights, though perhaps not as well-informed as she deserved to be. I'd made my choices about what truths to reveal and what to keep hidden. In Westwick, complete honesty is a luxury few can afford.

I lit a cigarette, watching the embers glow in the perpetual mist. My fedora was still damp from the chase through The Shallows, water damage being an occupational hazard in this town. The wound in my side had stopped bleeding, but the doctor said I'd feel it when the winter came. Some wounds aren't just physical.

In my pocket, the envelope of cash from the corporation felt heavier than it should. Not a bribe, they'd insisted. A consulting fee. Payment for my discretion regarding certain aspects of the case. For leaving certain names out of my report, while including others. For looking the other way on some matters while focusing attention on more "appropriate" targets.

I'd solved the puzzle, followed the breadcrumbs from the flooded basements of the old financial district to the pristine towers of corporate power. I'd uncovered names, connections, a conspiracy that reached higher than the church spires that dominated our skyline. Then I'd made my calculations about which parts of that truth the public could handle, which systems could be reformed, and which secrets were better left in the shadows.

The amphibious cab pulled up to the walkway, water sloshing against its modified chassis. The driver gave me a neutral nod—I wasn't a hero in this town, but I wasn't a pariah either. I existed in the gray area where most of Westwick's residents dwelled. "Evening, Mr. Morales-Singh," he called out.

Tomorrow, there would be selective justice. Some lower-level conspirators would face charges. Some corporate practices would be reformed. Some victims would receive compensation. Progress would be made—incremental, imperfect progress that left the fundamental power structures intact but perhaps slightly less corrupt than before.

That's how things change in this half-drowned city. Not through revolutions or perfect justice, but through calculated compromises and strategic concessions.

I tossed my cigarette into the dark water and watched it extinguish with a soft hiss. For a moment, I wondered if the compromises I'd made were truly necessary, or merely convenient. If there had been another way.

"Finnegan's," I told the cabbie, settling into the back seat with the weight of my decisions.

In Westwick, you learn that most choices aren't between right and wrong, but between wrong and less wrong. Between complete silence and partial truth.

Some mysteries are only half-solved. Some secrets remain partially hidden.

And some detectives learn that staying afloat sometimes means taking on water, even as you try to bail out the boat.

THE END
