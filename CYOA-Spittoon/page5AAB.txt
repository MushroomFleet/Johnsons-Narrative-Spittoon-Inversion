[Page 5AAB: Good Ending - Practical Justice]

... and in the end, pragmatic justice prevailed, though not without its compromises.

I stood on the elevated walkway of The Stilts, watching the fog roll in from the harbor. The moon hung low and heavy in the sky, its cratered surface a reminder of how much had changed since '48. My reflection wavered in the floodwaters below, distorted by the neon lights from the jazz club across the canal.

The case was closed—sealed with practical compromises rather than idealistic flourishes. The lunar artifact would be returned to the Shadow Agency's vault by morning, but under new oversight and regulations we'd fought hard to establish. The dame was safe in The Heights, her silence purchased with guarantees of protection and a new identity. In Westwick, perfect justice is as rare as a dry basement.

I lit a cigarette, watching the embers glow in the perpetual mist. My fedora was still damp from the chase through The Shallows, water damage being an occupational hazard in this town. The wound in my side had stopped bleeding, but the doctor said I'd feel it when the winter came. Some battles leave marks.

In my pocket, the business card of the district attorney felt worn at the edges. She'd presented the deal we'd ultimately accepted—limited prosecutions focusing on the worst offenders, immunity for those who testified, sealed indictments for others to ensure future cooperation. Half a loaf, as my father used to say, but better than going hungry.

I'd solved the puzzle, followed the breadcrumbs from the flooded basements of the old financial district to the pristine towers of corporate power. I'd uncovered names, connections, a conspiracy that reached higher than the church spires that dominated our skyline. Some of those names would face justice. Others would escape with warnings, fines, slapped wrists. The machinery of power never fully breaks down in this town.

The amphibious cab pulled up to the walkway, water sloshing against its modified chassis. The driver nodded in recognition—word travels fast in the half-submerged streets of Westwick. "The usual place, Mr. Morales-Singh?" he called out.

Tomorrow, the headlines would tell a partial truth. Justice served, but with asterisks. Reforms promised, though perhaps not all fulfilled. The corporations would pay reparations but admit no wrongdoing. The corrupt officials would resign but with pensions intact.

That's how progress happens in this half-drowned city. Not in floods, but in steady drips that wear away at the foundations of corruption.

I tossed my cigarette into the dark water and watched it extinguish with a soft hiss. For a moment, I considered the choice I'd made. The lines I'd bent without breaking. The imperfect justice I'd helped craft.

"Yeah, Finnegan's," I told the cabbie, settling into the back seat.

In Westwick, you learn that dry shoes and a clear conscience rarely go together. Sometimes you have to wade through murky waters to get anything done.

Some mysteries don't get perfect resolutions. Some villains escape with a scare.

And some detectives learn that while you can't drain the whole ocean, you can at least build better boats.

THE END
