... and in the end, I chose to save a life, even if it meant the evidence wasn't perfect.

I stood on the elevated walkway of The Stilts, watching the fog roll in from the harbor. The moon hung low and heavy in the sky, its cratered surface a reminder of how much had changed since '48. My reflection wavered in the floodwaters below, distorted by the neon lights from the jazz club across the canal.

The case was closed—though not as neatly as it could have been. The lunar artifact had been damaged during the rescue operation in Harbor Town, reducing its value as evidence. But the dame was safe, no longer hunted by corporate killers or Shadow Agency operatives with murky allegiances. In Westwick, sometimes you have to choose between perfect justice and saving a life.

I lit a cigarette, watching the embers glow in the perpetual mist. My fedora was still damp from the chase through The Shallows, water damage being an occupational hazard in this town. The wound in my side had stopped bleeding, but the doctor said I'd feel it when the winter came. A price worth paying for the life we'd saved.

In my pocket, the thank-you note from the dame felt like a talisman against cynicism. Her testimony was limited—she couldn't implicate the highest levels of the conspiracy without the artifact's data to back her claims. But she was alive to tell what she knew, to rebuild her life away from the shadows that had nearly claimed her.

I'd solved the puzzle, followed the breadcrumbs from the flooded basements of the old financial district to the pristine towers of corporate power. I'd uncovered names, connections, a conspiracy that reached higher than the church spires that dominated our skyline. While the biggest fish might have slipped the net, we'd caught enough of the school to disrupt their operation. Sometimes that has to be enough.

The amphibious cab pulled up to the walkway, water sloshing against its modified chassis. The driver smiled in recognition—I'd made the front page of the Tribune, the detective who'd saved the whistleblower from Harbor Town's deadliest pier. "Evening, hero," he called out, only half-joking.

Tomorrow would bring more cases, more shadows to chase through Westwick's half-drowned streets. But tonight, I knew a woman was sleeping safely because of choices I'd made. While the full truth of the conspiracy might never see the light of day, part of it had been exposed, and the corporations had been put on notice.

That's how you measure victory in this half-drowned city. Not in complete justice or perfect closure, but in lives saved and small lights kindled against the darkness.

I tossed my cigarette into the dark water and watched it extinguish with a soft hiss. For a moment, I felt something rare in Westwick—satisfaction. Pride in the choice I'd made when seconds counted and lives hung in the balance.

"Finnegan's," I told the cabbie, settling into the back seat with an unusual sense of peace.

In Westwick, you learn that sometimes people matter more than cases. That there are worse things than an incomplete file.

Some mysteries remain partially unsolved. Some evidence gets sacrificed for higher priorities.

And some detectives discover that in a city where so much has been lost to the waters, saving one soul can be victory enough.

THE END
