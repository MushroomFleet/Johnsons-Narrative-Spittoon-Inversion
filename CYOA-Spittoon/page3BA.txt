[Page 3BA: Lab Infiltration]

"You understand what you're agreeing to, detective?" The AeroCorp security chief—Harrington, according to his badge—stood before the wall-sized window overlooking the glittering buildings of The Heights. Everything about him was expensively controlled, from his tailored suit to his carefully neutral expression.

"I understand you need someone with my background," I replied, keeping my tone equally measured. "Someone who can investigate discreetly."

The corporate boardroom we sat in was sixty floors above the flood line, the perpetual mist of Westwick visible only as a cottony blanket far below. Up here, the elite of The Heights pretended the waters had never risen, that the city below them wasn't slowly drowning.

Harrington nodded. "Three researchers dead in two weeks. Proprietary lunar technology missing. Our board is... concerned."

By "concerned," he meant panicking. AeroCorp's stock had plummeted after whispers of the deaths had reached the financial district. They needed this handled quietly, without police reports or newspaper headlines. That's why they'd reached out to a private investigator known for discretion.

What they didn't know was that I'd already been investigating those deaths for days, following rumors from my contacts in Drowntown about experimental technology that had leaked from corporate labs. Technology that had killed people.

"I'll need complete access," I said, laying out my terms. "Research logs, personnel files, security recordings. Everything."

"Impossible," Harrington began, but the woman beside him—Dr. Lagos, head of research—raised a hand to silence him.

"We'll provide what's necessary," she said, her eyes sharp behind rimless glasses. "But you'll be escorted at all times. And you'll sign extensive non-disclosure agreements."

I could detect the fear beneath her professional demeanor. Not just fear for her job or the company, but deeper anxiety. Whatever they were developing in those labs, it frightened even its creators.

"When do I start?"

Three hours later, after signing enough paperwork to sink a small boat, I was being escorted through the gleaming halls of AeroCorp's research wing. The security guard—ex-military from his bearing—kept one hand near his holster at all times.

Dr. Lagos led us into a specialized lab where the air hummed with strange energies. "This is where Dr. Chen was found," she said, gesturing to a workstation still sealed with crime scene tape—their crime scene tape, not the police's. "Our internal security determined it was heart failure."

I studied the space, noting the advanced containment units, the specialized tools. "And the other two researchers?"

"Similar circumstances. Natural causes, according to our medical examiner."

"Three healthy scientists dead of 'natural causes' in two weeks," I said, not bothering to hide my skepticism. "All working on the same project."

Dr. Lagos's lips thinned. "We've considered the possibility of... other factors."

"Like the missing lunar artifact they were studying?"

Her surprise was poorly concealed. She hadn't expected me to know about that.

I moved toward a secured terminal. "I'll need access to their research data."

Dr. Lagos hesitated, then nodded to my escort, who swiped a security card. "You have one hour, detective. I'll return then."

When they left, I worked quickly, downloading copies of research notes, access logs, and security footage to the miniature camera disguised as a fountain pen in my pocket. The data painted a disturbing picture—experiments with lunar technology that defied conventional physics, increasingly unstable energy readings, and researchers documenting strange physical symptoms before their deaths.

Most damningly, records of a specialized containment unit signed out by someone with executive-level clearance just hours before the first death. A containment unit now missing.

The door slid open behind me. I expected Dr. Lagos or my escort, but instead found a young man in a lab coat, eyes wide with fear.

"You're investigating the deaths," he whispered, glancing nervously at the hallway. "I was Dr. Chen's assistant. There's something you need to see."

He led me to a hidden panel in the lab's floor, revealing a small safe. "Maya kept her own records, off the company servers. She didn't trust management." His hands shook as he worked the combination. "She said if anything happened to her, someone needed to know the truth."

Inside was a small data drive and a hand-drawn map leading to a location in Harbor Town.

"The artifact was just a fragment," the assistant explained. "The rest is hidden where only Maya knew. She said it was too dangerous to keep in one place." His voice dropped even lower. "People have already died for it. More will follow if AeroCorp gets the complete technology."

I had to make a decision. I could continue working with AeroCorp, using their resources to track down the missing artifact while potentially exposing corporate crimes from within. Or I could take this new evidence and pursue the investigation independently, following the murdered scientist's hidden trail.

Corporate resources versus independence. Inside access versus freedom to act.

You stand at the crossroads. Do you:
A) Report everything found to AeroCorp management (Turn to Page 4BAA)
B) Selectively report, keeping key information hidden (Turn to Page 4BAB)
