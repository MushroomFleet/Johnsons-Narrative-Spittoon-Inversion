The Shadow Agency representative adjusted her immaculate suit as she surveyed the lunar artifact on the table between us. The soft blue glow of the device reflected in her glasses, hiding her eyes. We sat in a sterile meeting room in their unmarked office building in The Heights, far above the waterline and the problems of ordinary citizens.

"Your work has been... thorough, Mr. Morales-Singh," she said, her voice as precisely modulated as everything else about her. "The Agency appreciates your discretion in this matter."

I kept my face neutral, though my side throbbed where the corporate enforcer's bullet had grazed me during the confrontation in The Shallows. "Just doing my job."

She slid a sleek folder across the table. "Your full fee, plus the agreed-upon hazard bonus. The Agency considers this case closed."

I didn't touch the folder. "And the people behind this? The names I provided?"

"Will be handled through appropriate channels." Her smile didn't reach her eyes. "Some of these individuals have significant connections. The process must be... delicate."

"Delicate." I let the word hang in the air between us. "Like how the dame nearly got her throat cut in Drowntown while your agents were being 'delicate'?"

The representative's expression didn't change. "A regrettable development. But Ms. Chen is safe now, and the artifact recovered. The technology it contains will not fall into unauthorized hands."

I thought about the partial copy of the artifact's data I'd made before contacting the Agency. About the names stored there, the connections to corporate boards and government officials. About how easily evidence could disappear in this town, especially when it implicated the powerful.

"The full report is in the file," I said, gesturing to the documents I'd provided. "Everything I found on the lunar tech smuggling operation."

She nodded, seemingly satisfied. "Then our business is concluded. The Agency will take possession of the artifact now."

I had a choice to make. I could hand over everythingâ€”the artifact, all my evidence, every scrap of intelligence I'd gathered about who was really behind the smuggling ring. Trust the system to work, the Agency to do its job despite its connections to the very people I'd been investigating.

Or I could keep something back. A small piece of lunar tech I'd separated from the main artifact. Insurance against the case being buried, against the truth being drowned like so much of old Westwick.

The weight of my military oath came back to me. The promise to follow the chain of command, to trust the system even when I couldn't see all its workings. I'd sworn to uphold order once, believed in institutions and their purposes.

"It's all yours," I said, pushing the artifact and the complete, unredacted file toward her. "I've done my part. Now the Agency needs to do theirs."

She seemed almost surprised by my compliance, but quickly recovered. "The Agency thanks you for your service," she said as she took possession of the artifact, securing it in a specialized containment case. "Your country thanks you."

I nodded, finally taking the folder with my payment. "Just make sure justice is served. That's all I ask."

Her smile was thin. "Justice is always served, Mr. Morales-Singh. In its proper measure and time."

As I left the Agency building and stepped out into the mist-shrouded evening, I felt lighter, unburdened by the weight of evidence and decisions. I'd done things by the book, followed procedure, trusted the system I once swore to protect.

Now all I could do was hope that trust wasn't misplaced.

You stand at the crossroads. Do you:
A) Report any withheld evidence and fully cooperate (Turn to Page 5ABA)
B) Anonymously leak key details to a journalist (Turn to Page 5ABB)
