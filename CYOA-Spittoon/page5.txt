... but in the end, the truth was as murky as the waters of The Depths.

I stood on the elevated walkway of The Stilts, watching the fog roll in from the harbor. The moon hung low and heavy in the sky, its cratered surface a reminder of how much had changed since '48. My reflection wavered in the floodwaters below, distorted by the neon lights from the jazz club across the canal.

The case was closed—officially, anyway. The lunar artifact would be returned to the Shadow Agency's vault by morning. The dame was safe in The Heights, though "safe" is a relative term in Westwick. Whoever had hired those goons from Drowntown would be back eventually. They always come back, like the tide.

I lit a cigarette, watching the embers glow in the perpetual mist. My fedora was still damp from the chase through The Shallows, water damage being an occupational hazard in this town. The wound in my side had stopped bleeding, but the doctor said I'd feel it when the winter came. Another scar to add to the collection.

In my pocket, the small piece of lunar tech felt heavier than it should. Insurance, I told myself. Evidence, maybe. Or just a reminder that in Westwick, nothing is ever what it seems. Not the corporations funding their secret labs beneath Harbor Town, not the cops with their convenient blind spots, and certainly not the client who'd paid me triple my usual rate.

I'd solved the puzzle, followed the breadcrumbs from the flooded basements of the old financial district to the pristine towers of corporate power. I'd uncovered names, connections, a conspiracy that reached higher than the church spires that dominated our skyline. But knowing the truth and proving it were two different things in this town.

The amphibious cab pulled up to the walkway, water sloshing against its modified chassis. The driver didn't ask where I was headed—there's only one place a man like me goes after a case like this. Back to my office above Finnegan's Bar, where the whiskey is cheap and the questions are few.

Tomorrow, I'd file my report. Type up the official version—the one without the missing pieces, without the names too powerful to mention. I'd collect my fee and watch the newspapers spin their sanitized version of events. Maybe someday I'd tell the real story, but not while the players were still in the game.

That's how it goes in this half-drowned city. Justice is as fluid as the waters that claimed The Depths. Truth evaporates like morning fog under the harsh light of self-preservation.

I tossed my cigarette into the dark water and watched it extinguish with a soft hiss. For a moment, I thought about the choice I'd made tonight. The line I'd crossed. Whether it made me any better than the people I hunted.

"You coming or what, Morales-Singh?" the cabbie called out, breaking my reverie.

I adjusted my trench coat and stepped into the vehicle, leaving my doubts on the walkway behind me. In Westwick, you learn to live with the choices you make, or you drown in them.

Some mysteries aren't meant to be solved. Some secrets belong to the depths.

And some detectives learn to keep swimming, even when the current pulls them under.

THE END
